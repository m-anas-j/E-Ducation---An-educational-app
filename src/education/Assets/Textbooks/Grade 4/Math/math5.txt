Key ideas of Junior high school mathematics emphasized In 
'thls text are: structure of arithmetic from an algebraic view-
:point; the real number system as a progressing development; 
;metricand non-metric relations in geometry. Throughout the 
'materialstheas ideas are associated wlth their applications, 
.Important at this level are experience with and appreciation of 

abstract concepts, the role of definition, development of 
precise vocabulary and thought, experimentation, and proof. 
Substantial progress can be made on these concepts in the juniorhigh school. 

Fourteen experimental unita far use In the seventh and/ eighth grades were written in the summer of 1958 and tried out1 by approximately 100 teachers in 12 centers in various parts1 of the country in the ~choolyear 1958-59. On the basis of 
I teacher evaluations theee unita were revised during the summer 

of 1959 and, wlth a number of new units, were made a part of 
sample textbooks for grade 7 and a book of experimental units 
for grade 8. In the school year 1959-60, these seventh and 
eighth grade books were used by about 175 teachers in many 
parts of the country,and then further revised in the summer of 
1960. 

Mathematice is fascinating to many persons because of its 
opportunities for creation and discovery as well as for its 
utility. It is continuously and rapidly growing under the 
prodding of both Intellectual curiosity and practical applica-
tions. Even junior high school students may formulate 
mathematical questions and conjectures which they can test and 
perhaps settle; they can develop systematic attacks on 
mathematical problems whether or not the problems have routine 
OP immediately determinable solutions. Recognition of these 
important factors has played a considerable part in selection 
of content and method in thls text,

We firmly believe mathematics can and should be studiedi with success and enjoyment. ~tis our hope that this text may1 greatly assist all teachers who use it to achieve thls highlyI desirable goal.

NOTE TO TFACHERS 

I Based on the teaching experience of nearly 200 junior 

thigh school teachere In all parta of the country and the estimates!of' the authors of the revision ( including junior high school 

teachem), it is recommended that teaching time for Part 1, be 

as follows :

Teachers are urged to trg not to exceed theae approximate 
time allotments so that pupile will not miss the chapters at the 
end of the courae, Some classes will be able to finish certain 
chaptere Ln leas than the estimated time. 
Throughout the text, problems, topics and section8 which 
were designed for the better students are indicated by an 
aaterisk (*) . Items starred in thla mer should be used or 
omitted aa a means of adjusting the approximate time schedule. 


Chapter 1 

WHAT IS MATHEMATICS? 

General Remarks 
This chapter is intended to give the pupil an appreciation for 
the Importance of rnathematlcs. Its objectives are: 

I. To develop an understanding of what mathematics is as 
opposed to simple computation. 
11. To develop an appreciation of the role of mathematics 
in our culture. 
111. To motivate pupils by pointing out the need for mathe 
maticlans and for mathematically trained people. 
Since this chapter is much different from ordinary textbook 
material it will need a different treatment. The purpose of the 
chapter is -not to teach many facts or skills, but rather to build 
an enthusiasm for the study of mathematics. Good attctudes will 
be built if you use imagination and enthusiasm in getting these 
objectives across to the puplls. Since the material Is not to be

-

taught for mastery, we strongly recommend that no test be given

-

covering the contents of this chapter, 

Experience shows that this chapter can be covered within six 
to eight lessons. Certaknly no more than eight days should be 
devoted to it. 

Were seventh graders are in a new school situation and have 
so many interruptions during the first few days, some teachers may 
wfsh to precede this chapter with review exercises which are more 
familiar to the pupils. 

Note that Exercises 1-6, (Page 13) and Exercises 1-7, fa age 14) 
are suggestions for background study to be carried on throughout 
the year. These should be begun during the first week, with 
periodic reports on progress by pupils. Where guldance personnel 
are available, their services should be solicited to help the 
class outline a plan of action for the year. 


It might be worthwhile to have the pupils read this chapter 
again at the end of the year. The problems might also be solved 
again. They should be much eaaier to aolve after the courae has 
been completed. 

Encourage the more able student8 to solve the brainbuaters 
but be ready to help them if they have difficulties. Most pupils 
will want to puzzle over the brainbusters for a few days. For 
thie reason, only Individual help Is suggested until the time 
seems appropriate for general class diacusslon. 

1-1. Mathematics ---

as a Method of Reasoning, 
Page &. It might provide additional challenge to emphasize to the 
pupila that Exercises 1-1 and Exercises 1-2 are not easy. More-
over, no slmple formula for solution can be given. Some of the 
pupils (and many parental) will certainly find the problems diffi-
cult and time-consuming at this stage. You may not wish to 
assign all the problems in these two sectlone. 

Answers to Exe~cises1-1--Page 2: 

1. THOsons cross; one returns. Father crosses; other son 
returns. Two sons cross. 
2, No. They need a boat carrying 225 pounds. Solution as 
in 1 above, 

3. Man takea goose and returns alone. He takes fox and 
returns with goose. He takea corn across river and 
returns alone to pick up goose. 
4, Yes, Thfs depends on the fact that 8x + 5y = 2 has 
solutions in integers, such as x = -1, y = 2 and x = 4, 
y = -6. The first means that if you fill the 5-gallon 
jug twice and empty it once Into the 8-gallon jug, you 
will have 2 gallons left. The second solution means 
that if you fill the 8-gallon jug four times and use it 
to fill the 5-gallon jug 6 times, you will have 2 gallons 
left, Point out that the first solution is best.

-5. Most pupils will need paper and pencil for this one, As 
they attempt the solution in front of the class it is a 
good idea to minimize the help from others in the class. 
If an error 18 made, another student should be selected to 

1 present hia solution. It should be pointed out that a

Balance the two groups of 3 marbles each. If they balance 
then it is only necessary to balance the remaining two 
marbles to find the heavy one. If the two groups of 3 
marbles do not balance, take the heavier group. Of the 3 
marbles in the heavier group balance any 2 marbles. If 
they balance, the remaining marble is the heaviest one. 
If the 2 marbles do not balance, the heaviest will be 1 
of the 2 on the balmce. 

7, In aolving the problem is it practical to try out all the 
possible waye the dominoes may be placed on the board? 
This would be difficult because there are more than 
65,536 ways to cover the whole board, The solution may 
be found in another way: 
How many squares are there altogether on the board? 

(64) 

How many squares muet be covered? (62) 

What is special about the two square8 next to each 

other? (They sre of different colors. ) 

What Is speclal about the two opposite corners? 

co hey are the same color. ) 


If you place any number of domlnoes on the board can you 
say anythlng about the kinds of squares which will be 
covered? How doea this compare with the kinds of squares 
which you are supposed to cover? Do you have to make 
even one experiment in order to get the answer to the 
origlnal problem? Can two squares of the same color be 
covered with one domino? The answer to thla question 
ahould help some of the students reason why the solution 
Is impoaalble. 

1-2. Deductive Reasonlnq. 
Pam 3. After the concept of deductive reasoning has been Intro-
duced, it ia still necessary to give the students an understanding 
of Its importance. Examplea of scientific advances in which de-
ductive reaaoning was used might be Elnstelnts discovery of the 
atomic energg formula E = MC2 , apace travel, satellites, digital 
computer development, nuclear energg, etc.

1-From Arithmetic -to Mathematlcs. 

Page 5. Before considering Gauss's discovery of summing an arith-
metlc series, you may wish to offer the following as an example of 
a scientific experiment in which mathematics is used. 

Make a pendulum by fastening a 
weight to a string 40 inches long. psiling 
Attach the string to an object that eye hook 
will not move, The pendulum ehould 
swing freely. Set the pendulum 
into motion. Count the number of 
times it swings back and forth in 
30 seconds. Shorten the string by 
5 inches and repeat this experiment. f 
Shorten again by 5 inches and do it 
again. Make a table of your ob-
0 
i,--

Length of string No. of gwings 
In knchee in 30 seconds 

Does there aeem to be a relationshfp between the length of 
the pendulum and the time? Can you predict the number of swings 
in 30 seconds If the string is 20 inches long? How does the 
number of swings depend upon the length of the atring? 

You have actually repeated an experiment done by Galileo 
about 400 years ago. Galileo was a famous Italian scientist who 
lived in the years 1564-1642. He got the idea for the experiment 
by watching a hanging light fixture swing back and forth, He 
timed the swing by means of his pulse beat. He was one of the 
first aclentists to show how important it was to Investigate 
problems by the experimental method. 


In mathematics we often use the inductive method to discover 
something. Then we use deductive reasoning to prove that it is 
true. 

John Freedrich Karl Gauss was born in Brunawick, Germany, in 
1777. He died in 1855 at the age of 78. The pupils may be inter-
ested in noting that his lifetime almost spanned the years from the 
American Revolution to the Civil War. 

Many mathematicians consider Gauss as one of the three great-
eat mathematicians of all times, the other two being Newton and 
Archimedes. 

In this age of space exploration'lt is interesting to note 
that Gauss developed powerful methods of calculating orbits of 
comets and planets. His interests extended also to such fields 
as magnetism, gravitation, and mapping. In 1833 Gauss invented 
the electric telegraph, which he and his fellow worker, Wilhelm 
Weber, used as a matter of course in sending messages. 

In 1807 Gauss was appointed Director of the Gdttingen 
Observatory and Lecturer of Mathematics at G8ttingen University. 
In later years the greatest honor that a German mathematician 
could have was to be appointed to the professorahip which Gauss 
had once held. 

Thla sectlon deals with Gauss's discovery of the known method 
of sming an arithmetic series. It dramatizes how some pupils 
(and mathematicians) apply insight to finding a aolution to a 
problem. Your better students should be told that there are 
methods other than Gauaals for finding the sum of a seriee of 
numbers. Some students might be encouraged to discover methods 
of their om for addfng number series quickly. 

The "middle number" method is one that may be used. This 
scheme can be used for an even or an odd number of integers. The 
following examples may be used to explain this method athe 
students who have tried to discover other methods. 


In this series the middle number (4) is the average of t.he 
individual numbers of the series. The sum is the product of the 
middle umber (4)and the nu~nberof integers in the series or 
4 x 7 = 25. 

Some pupils may prefer to think of the series as 
(1 + 7)+ (2 + 6)+ (3 + 5) + 4 = (4 + 4) c (k + 4) + (4 + 4) 
+4=7~4=28. 

ExampleE. 1 +> =?

t 3 + 4 + 5+ 6+7 -1-8 

In this case the "middle number" is halfway between h and 5, 
1 1 

or . Then the product (%) x 8 = 36 is seen to give the correct 

L 

Sum. 
It may seem more plausible here to write the sum as 
(1+ 8)+ (2 + 7) + (3 + 6) + (4+ 5) = 

Clearly, Gauss's method is to be preferred in this case. 

Answers to Exercises 1-3--page 6: 

1. Another method is this: 2 + 4 = 2 + 3, 1+ 5 = 3 + 3. 
That is, the sum is the same as: 
3+3+3+3+3=5~3=15. 
This can be callcd the "averaging method." 
2. Either method works. Gauss method: 8x5.

8. Yes, provided that the numbefs are In arithmetic progrea-
aion; that is, there 18 the same difference between each 
pair of adjacent numbers, 
9, Yes. If we start with 1 there are 200 Integers in the 

series giving us v.If we start with 0 there 

are 201 integers in the series giving us w. 

The products of like factors are equal. The method also 
may be used in a aerlee if we select a number other than 
1 or 0 as a starting point. Some of the better atudenta 
may investigate whether the method works in other number 
series, 

10. (a) If you add 1 to the quantity, the sum up to any 
number is equal to the next number. Hence, the 
sum plus 1 is equal to 2 
256 s 512. Therefore, 
the sum is 511. 
(b) This is more In the spirit of Gauss: 
Sum = I + 2 + 4 + ... + 256 
-

2 x sum = 2 + 4 + ...+ 256 + 512 
Subtracting: Sum = 511. 

11. Sum = 2 + (6+ 18 + .., + 486) 
3 x sum = 6 + 18 + ... + 486 + 1458 
Subtracting: 2 x (the sum) = 1458 -2 = 1456 
Sum, 728. 
1-4. Kind8 of Mathematics. 

Page 7. DiBcussion of this section should emphasize the dynamic 

character of mathematics. It is not a "dead" subject as many 

parents believe, 


It is important also to point out here (and throughout the 
course) that certain important ingredients are commoli to all the 
many varieties of mathematics. The method of logical reasoning, 
the use and manipulation of abstract symbols, the insistence on 
precision of thought and clarity of expression, the emphasls on 
genera: results--these are some characteristics which need to be 
stressed whenever possible. 

Probability--page 9: 

This section gives only a very brief introduction to proba-
bility. Although students may become interested at this point and 
attempt more complex problems, it would bo bctter if they waited. 
A chapter on probability is included in Vol~un~ Some supple-

Class Activities 1-6 and 1-?--paps 13-14: 

The exercises suggested in Section 1-6 and Section 1-7 should 
be undertaken as year-long projects to be reported on periodically. 
Much of this information would be good bulletin-board materisl. 
A general aim is to make the pupils alert to the current news 
relating to mathematics and mathematicians. As the year progresses 
they should gain an increasing appreciation of the important role 
mathematical thought is playing in our present civilization.

mathematicians and where they are employed,

A survey of college requirements in the vocations students 
may choose should be especially valuable at this stage. We hope 
it may eaee the difficult task of effective guidance in choosing 
their high school courses. 

One word of caution is perhaps warranted here. The purpose 
of these sections on mathematics today 1s to call attention to its 
central role in the pupil's daily life. The necessity for a mini-
mum howledge of mathematics is to be stressed. ---A

1-9, Highlights of First-Year Junior High School Mathematics. 
Page 16, This section is intended to give the student a general 
overview of the scope of the first-year course in junior high 
school mathematics. It is intended to broaden his ideas of mathe-
matics by discussing very briefly the topics that will be studied. 
This, together with the introduction of logical reasoning and 
probability earlier in this chapter, will help dispel the general 
idea that mathematics is computation only. 

Reading this chapter again later in the year may strengthen 
the student's understanding of what mathematics is, 


Chapter 2 

Introduction 

For this unit little background is needed except familiarity 
with the nunher symbols and the basic operations with numbers. 
The purpose of the unit is to deepen the pupilis understmding of 
the decimal notation for whole numbers, especially with regard to 
plzce value, and thus to help him delve a little deeper into the 
reasons for the procedures, which he already knows, for carrying 
out the addition and multiplication operations. One of the best 
ways to accomplish this is to consider systems of nmber notations 
using bases cther than ten. Since, in using a new base, the 
pupil must necessarily look at the reasons for "carrying" and the 
other mechanical procedures in a new light, he should gain deeper 
insight into the decimal system. A certain amount of computation 
in other systems is necessary to "fix1'these ideas, but such 
computation should not be regarded as an end in itself. Some of 
the pupils, however, may enjoy developing a certain proficiency 
in using new bases In computing. 

Perheps the most important reason for introducing ancient 
spbolisms for numbers is to contrast them with our decimal system, 
in which not only the symbol, but its position, has significance. 
It should be shown, as cther systems are presented, that positlon 
has some significance in them also, The Roman System has a start 
in this directior: in that XL represents a different r?wriber from 
LX, but the start was s very primitive one. The Babylonians also 
made use of position, but lacked a symbol for zero until about 
200 B.C. The Babylonian symbol '$2 denoted the absence of a

If 

flgure but apparently was not used in computation. The numeral 
zero is necessary in a positional system. In order for the pupils 
to appreciate the important characteristics of our system or 
writing numbers, the following table may be discussed. 


Base Place Value Zero 
Egyptian Ten No No 
hbylonian Sixty Yes Llrnited 
meaning 
Roman Varied No, but it has No 
positional value 
Decimal Ten Yes Yes 

Pupils should not be expected to memorize ancient symbolism. It 
is recommended that little time be spent on the use of the symbols 
themselves. 

It is especially important to distinguish between a number 
and the symbols by which it is represented. Some of the proper-
ties usually connected with a number are really properties of Its 
notatlon. The facts that, in decimal notatlon, the numeral for 
a number divisible by 5 ends in 5 or 0, and that has an unending

7 

decimal equivalent (0.333.. . ) ,are il1ust:rations. Most of the 
properties with which we deal are properties of the numbers 
themselves, and are entirely independent of the notation in which 
they are represented. Examples of such properties or numbers are: 
2 + 3 = 3 + 2; the number eleven is a prime number; and six is 
greater than five. The distinction between a nunber and the 
notation In which it is expressed should be emphasized whenever 
there Is opportunity. 

An attempt has been made to use "number" and "numeral"wlth 
precise meaning in the text. For example, "numerals" are wrftten, 
but "numbers1' are added. A numeral is a written symbol. A number 
is a concept. Later In the text it may be cumbersome to the 
point of annoyance to speak of "adding the numbers represented 
by the numerals written below." In such case the expression may 
be elided to "adding the numbers below." 

At several points, numbers are represented by collections of 
xis. Exercises of this kind are important, because they show the 
role of the base in grouping the x's, as well aa the significance 
of the digits in the numeral for the number. 


Suggested Time Schedule 

It is important that only enough time be spent on the various 
sections to secure the understandings desired. The historical 
symbols themselves are not Important. Neither are the numerals in 
other bases valuable in themselves, but the Ideas that they help 
to clarify are important. 

Familiarity with the subject matter is an important factor In 
a smooth presentation, Teachers report that a second experience 
with this material is much easier than the first. The lesson 
moves more rapidly, apparently, as the teacher gains confidence 
in the subject matter presented. 

Homogeneously grouped classes undoubtedly will alter the 
suggested schedule since the more able students can complete the 
chapter in less time while less able students may require a consid-
erably longer period of time on various sections. The following 
schedule may then be adapted to local needs, taking into consi-
deration the length of class periods and other factors. It 
should be remembered that extra time spent on this chapter will 

necessarily reduce the number of days available for later important 
chapters.

2-1. History of Numerals. 
Pa~e21. The purpose of the historical material is to trace the 
continuing need for convenient symbols and for a useful way of 
writlng expressions for numbers. The idea of "one-to-one" corre-
sporrdence is introduced. It Is developed later and should not be 
defined here where the emphasis is upon numerals rather than upon 
number. Egyptian symbolism is Introduced to familiarize the 
pupils with one of the first Important systems of notation. Do 
not consume an excessive amount of time in discussing the Egyptian 
or Babylonian systems. 
Page -22, The Babylonians were among the first to use place value. 
The base sixty system is mentioned because of later reference to 
ft, particularly In measurement. There is evidence that the 
Babylonians also used symbols like 03 but there is no need to 
introduce these to the pupils. No pupil should be required to 
memorize ancient symbolism except in the case of Roman numerals. 
Paue 3.The Roman system may be stressed because of its conth-

ued use. Note that the subtracting prfnciple was a late develop-
ment. It may be pointed out that computation in ancient symbolism 
was complex and somet?mos very difficult. Because of this, 
various devices were used, such as the sand reckoner, counting 
table, and abacus. After decimal numerals became known, algo-
rithms were devised and people were able to calculate with symbols 
alone. There was much oppoaltlon In Europe to the introduction 
and use of Hindu-Arabic numerals, especially on the part of the 
abaclsta. As the new system became accepted, the abacus and 
other computing devices slowly disappeared in Europe.

2-2. The Decimal System. 
Pa~e26, The Illustration of grouplng in tens suggests a method 
useful in mental calculation as 37 + 62 is 3 tens + 6 tens + 7 + 2 
which Is 99. Note that parenthesea are used to ahow that certain 
combinations are to be considered as representing a single numeral 
In a later chapter a different uae of parentheses will be dls-
cussed in greater detail. lkphasize the value represented by a 
digit and the value of position in decimal notation. 

Rnphasize the importance of the Invention of a useful system 
which lends itself easily to calculation. The efficiency of the 
decimal system lies in a combination of factors. 

1. Only a few symbols are needed, no matter how large or 
small the number expressed. Some students may observe 
that we use ten symbols while the Babylonians used just 
two and the Egyptians and the Romans each used 7. How-
ever, in the decimal system no additional symbols are 
ever needed as larger numbers are Introduced; this Is 
not true of the other systems. 
2. Place value in which each position corresponds to a 
power of the base is of importance In a aystem used for 
calculation. 
3. The concept of zero as a place holder Is essential in the 
development of a place value system. 
Page 28. The reading and writing of numerals may be treated a8 a 
review, or if needed, as a thorough study, depending on the needs 
of pupils. Some pupils may know and understand this material 
completely. Others may have a very limited proficiency in this 
area. 

A class discussion might deal with the Following: 

Suppose we used systematic names for numerals such as "two 
tenst1for twenty, "two tens, one" for twenty-one, "ten, one1'for 
eleven, and ''ten, two1'for twelve. How many different, basic 
words would be needed to name all counting numbers up to a 
trillion? eme ember that a numeral like "one hundred, three tens, 
sixN is made up of basic words used many times in other numerals.)

2-4. Numerals in Base Seven. 
Page z,The purpose of teaching systems of numeration In bases 
other than ten is not to produce facility in calculating with 
such systems. A study of an unfamiliar system aids in under-
standing a familiar one, just as the study of a foreign language 
aids us in understanding our own. The decimal system is so 
familiar that its structure and the ideas involved In its algo-
rithms are easily overlooked. In this section attentfon is 
focused on numerals, rather than on numbers. 
Page 2. Questions may arise about the notation for a numeral 
to base seven. We do not wrlte ''157" because the symbol "7" does 
not occur in a system of numeration to this base. Replacing the 
numeral by the written word emphasizes this fact. 
Iater in the chapter and in succeeding chapters, some classes 
may agree to indicate the base, as dlfferent systems of nwneratlon 
are introduced, by a numeral In decimal notation. They may agree 
that they will regard the subscript in this case as alyays based 
on ten. Thus they may write for 25seventhe expression 25?; for 

latwelve the expression g12; and for llOtwo, 1102 
After the pupils have had practice in grouping by sevens, 
introduce counting. Fuplls enjoy counting in turn, and helping

Addition, Base Ten 

Pupils should be helped to observe the symmetry of the table

6 + 8, for example,and that this is true for any pair of numbers. 
Uter they will learn that this la the comutative property of

There is no value in memorlzfng this table. The process is 
more important than the facts. The point to be emphasized is that 
numbers and number properties are independent of the numerals or 
symbols used to represent the numbers. Commutativfty holds in 
base seven as well as base ten because it is a property of numbers,

seven to base ten numerals than the reverse, This section gives 
much detail in order to provide help to pupils who may have 

trouble. 

Ask for the highest power of seven which is contained in 
the number given in base ten numeration. For example, consider 

4 3

63Sl0. Is 7 contained in 63410? or (34310)?

or (2401~~) Is 7 
After we have taken as many 343101s as possible from 63410, how 
much remains? The next power of 7 is 72. How many 491015 are 
contained in 29lI0? Finally, how many 7's, and how many 1's are 
left?

74 groups of 7 are taken away. These groups of 7 are then put 
together in groups of 7 sevens with 4 groups left for the numeral 
in the 7 place. The process is repeated to find the digits for

2-8. The-Blnaq -and Duodecimal Systems. 
Page 56. Junior high school pupfls are often intrigued by a more 
extended discussion of computers than is found in the text. This 
is something you might brlng out in classroom discussion. For 
example, you might say, "NOW that we have seen how a row of 
lights may be used to represent a number using the binary system 
of nwneratfon, how might we design a simple adding machine?" 
It is unimportant and quite beside the point, at thls stage, 
for the pupil to be concerned with the electrlcal problems of 
design. He can, however, dlscover what such a machine might look 
like and what it must do, In the process he may galn some under-
standing of the fact that the binary system of numeration enables 
one to reduce computational problems to purely mechanical and 
electrlcal ones in a rather slmple way. 

Suppose we wish to design a machine to add any two numbers 
whlch can be written In the binary scale with no more than 5 
digits. We will need three rows of lights. 

c O00G00 

[pages 54-561 


L 

The numbers to be added will be entered into the machine by 
turning on approppiate lights in rows A and B. The sum is to 
be shown in Row C. The switches which operate the lights in 
Row C are to be wired In such a way that they are activated 
by the lights In rows A and 3. Our task is to deacrlbe just 
when a light in Row C is to be on and when it Is to be off. 

Consider a few simple addition problems, and observe how 
they appear both in binary numerals and in llghts. Suppose we 
wiah to add 10IOt, and lootwo 

.LUAU n VwWw

two 

lootwo 

AAlVtwo 

From this problem we can recognize two requirements for the 
' wlring of our machlne. 

I. In a given column, if the lights in both Rows A and 
3 are off then the light in that column In Row C 
should also be off. 
I 
I 
2. In a given column, if one of the two lights in Rows A 
and 3 is on then the llght in that column in Row C 
should turn on. 
Now consider what happens when we add 10lltwoand 10ltwo. 
Here we need to "carry,fl and our machine is not equipped to do 

this. It doesn't mow what to do if two lights In a given 
column are on. We need one more row of lights; a !1 carrying row." 
The machine must look like this: 

with Row X used only for carrying. The second addition looks 
like this: 


When -we turn on lights in Rows A and 3 as shown, the 
indicated lights in Rows C and X must turn on automatlcally. 
'Il~uswe see a third requlrement for our wlring. 

3 If, in a given column, any -two lights In Rows A, B, 
or X are on then the light in Row C will remain off 
and the light in Row X in the column mediately to 
the left will turn on. 

Requirement 3 says that if we have 

then we must have 

Finally, we have 

4. If, in a given colm, all the lights in Row8 A, B, 
and X are on, then the light in Row C must go on 
and also the light in Elow X of the column immediately 
to the left is to go 'on. 
The addition 

loltwo 

would appear on the machine aa 


x 0.e..

o.... 

B 00.0. 
c 0.0.00 

and the sum 101OOtw, would appear in Row C of lights almost as 
soon as we had entered the numbers llllt, and 10ltwo in Rows A 
and B. We have designed an adding machine In the sense that 
requirements 1, 2, 3 and 4 -can be built into a box with the re-
quired rows of lfghts by means of switches and relays. The 
Fmportant thing for the pupil at this stage is not the electrical 
problem, itself, but the knowledge that the binary system of 
notation makes it possible to reduce computational problems to 
purely mechanical and electrical construction in thls rather 
simple way. 

As an extensfon of the discussfon, you might ask how we 

might use -two of these addlng machines to build a new machine 
for adding three numbers together. If we use the notation 

to Indicate two lights wired so that they are always 
lfghted or unlighted together, then such a machine could be 
diagrammed as follows 

If each of the smaller boxes within the larger box is an 
adding machine of the type described above then the large box 
is a computer which will add trlples of numbers. If the binary 
numerals of the numbers are entered in Rows I, I1 and 111, the 
sum appears in the bottom Row C.

The use of binary notation in high speed computers is, of 
course, well known. The binary system is used for computers aince 
there are only two digits, and an electric mechanism Is either 
IIon" or "off." Such an arrangement is called a flip-flop 
mechanism. A number of pamphlets dfstributed by IBM, bmington 
Rand, and similar sources may be obtained by request and used 
for supplementary reading and study. "yes No -One zero" pub-
lished by Esso Standard Oil Co., 15 West Slst,, New York 19, 
Mew York is available for the asking only in states served by 
Esso. 

It ahould be of interest that the sm 11001 + 110 looks the 
same in the binary system, decimal system, and, In fact, all 
positional number systems. The meanlng, however, Is quite dif-
ferent . 

The base two has the disadvantage that, while only two 
different digfts are used, many more places are needed to express 
numbers in binary notation than in decimal, e.g., 

2000t,n = ll,lll,O1o,OOO~wo 
Pupils may be interested in the reminder method for changing 
a number from one base to another. This method of changing 25ten 
to binary notation rests on repeated diviaion by 2, to Identify 
the powera of 2 whose sum is 25. To change 25ten to base three, 
repeat divlsion by 3; to base four, divide by 4; am? ao on. 
The division is shown below for changing 25te,to binary 
notation, followed by an interpretation of the results of the 
diviaion at each stage. It will be noted that the remainder8 
in reverse order lndfcate the digits in binary numePsls. 
Recall that 2' = 1. 


Here is a set of cards which can be used in a number trick. 

Uslng the first four cards, tell a person to choose a number 
between 1 and 15, to pick out the cards containing that number and 
to give them to you. By adding the numbers at the top of the 
cards he gives you, you can tell him the number he chose. Note 
that the numerals at the top of the cards represent the powers 

By using all flve cards, you can pick out ra~neralsfrom 1 to 

31. The trick is based on the application of the binary numerals. 
Xf you have a peg board and some match sticks, you can 
represent base two nunerals on the board. Leave a hole blank for 
0 and put in a match stick for one. Represent two numbers on the 
board, one below the other, and try adding on the board. 

The twelve system uses two dlgfts more than the decimal 
aystem. From some points of view twelve is a better choice for 
a base than ten. Many products are packaged and sold by the 
dozen and by the gross. Twelve is divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6 
as well as by 12 and 1. Ten is divisible only by 1, 2, 5, and 

10. Because it employs a larger base, large numbers may be

12. The binary system 9s extremely simple in computation. 
Large numbers are tedious to write. 
The duodecimal system may be used conveniently 
to represent large numbers. Twelve is divisib~eby 
1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12 while ten is dfvisible only by 
1, 2, 5 and 10. The twelve system requires more 
computational "facts" which will Increase difficulties 
in mernorlzing tables of addition and multiplication. 
We do use twelve In counting dozens, gross, etc., and 
in some of the common measures of length. 

14. Five welghts; 1 oz., 2 oz., 4 oz., 8 oz., may be used 
to check any weight up to 15 ounces. By adding a 16 oz. 
weight, any weight up to 31 ounces may be checked. 
15. People who work with computers often use the base eight. 
To change from binary to octal and back Is simple with 
the help of the table: 
Binary Octal 

For example, we have 

Note the grouping of numerals by threes In the binary 
numeral. The sum of the place values of digits in each 
group results in the octal numeral. Hence 

111 = (1 x 4) + (1 x 2) + (1 x 1) = 7, etc.

WHOLE NUMBERS 

3-1. Countinp; Numbers. 
Page 67. Understandfngs to be developed in this section: 

(a) Number is an idea. 
(1) Small numbers can be learned without counting, 
some large ones by patterns. (Cards, ~ominoes) 
(2) The number of members of any set can be found by 
matching the members of theset with some standard 
set. This is a clwnsy method If the number of 
members Is large, as the standard sets must them-
selves be large. 
(3) Matching the members of a set with a memorized set 
of sounds representing the countlng numbers is the 
best known way of finding the number of members in 
a set. 

(b) One-to-one correspondence. 
Two sets are in a one-to-one correspondence when 
each member of one set is matched with only one 
member of the other set and vice-versa. 
(c) "~ountingmmbers" are sometimes calf ed "natural numbers1' 
(d) The name that we give to the set of counting numbers 
and zero Is "whole numbers." The counting numbers do 
-not include zero.

3-2. Commutative Properties for Whole Numbers. 
Page '70. The principal objective In the study of the commutative, 
associative, and dlstributive properties is to have the puplls 
understand their statements in mathematical language; to dia-
tingulsh one property from another; and to recognize the property 
or properties, that may be used in such problems as in Exercises 
3 and 4. These are not propertiea that are being proved. The 
pupils have used them for a long the, but they probably have 
not had names for them and have not recognized when they have 
been uslng them. 

The pupils will be helped in understanding the commutative 
property if they have some small objects with which to work. 
Pieces of paper will do but cubical blocks will be better. Cubi-
cal blocks will be more useful in illustrating the associative 
property for multiplication. lhphasize that the commutative 
property 1s a property of (belongs to) the operation of addition 
and Is not dependent upon the numeration system that Is used. 


! 
!
Use Roman numerals and numbers in base five to illustrate. For 
' example in base five add 

This is a good qpportunity to review numbers in numeration systems 
other than that with base ten. 

Students should be taught to add ''up the column" as well as 
IIdom the colwnn." Use three whole numbers in the addition since 
the use of three numbers will not only illustrate commutativity 
but will lead very naturally into associativity.

Then have them push the first two sets together and count the 
total (3 -I-2) + 4. Then after rearranging have them push the 
second two sets together and count the total 3 + (2 -k 4). Use 
sufficient variations of this procedure to lead to the under-
standing that (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) where a, b, c are any 
counting numbers.

Different sets of boxes may be made to Illustrate 2 x (3 x 4), 
(2 x 3) x 4 and many others. Again, emphasfs is upon arrival

3-5. Sets and the Closure Property. 
Page -84. Pnphasis here is placed upon (1) understanding the 
meaning of set and (2)the meaning of a set closed under an opera-
tion. Pupils will give many examples of sets. There is just one 
empty set, The set of marbles which has no marbles in It is the 

same as the set of coins which a pupil has in his pocket if he 

[pagee 83-84 1 


has no coins in his pocket. 

Good examples of sets closed under addition: 

The set of whole numbers. 

The set of counting numbers. 

Then ask if they are closed under multiplication. Lr:fier 
subtraction? Under division? 

Rnphasize that if just one pair of counting numbers can be 
found such that thefr difference (or quotient) is not a counting 
number, then the set of counting numbers Is not closed under sub-
traction (or dlvlsion) . For example, 9-12 is not a counting 
number for there is no counting number which can be added to 12 
to get 9 and 12 is not a counting number slnce there Is no 
counting number which can be multiplied by 9 to get 12.

Page 88. The basic concepts In this section are: 

1. The meaning of inverse. 
2. Addition and multiplication have the closure, 
cormutative, and associative properties, while 
their inverses do not. 
The meaning of inverse may be explained by giving an example, 
"I write on the chalkboard" may be stated as one actually writes 
"inverse" on the board. Then the teacher may say "The inverse 
of writing on the board is erasing the board." The board may be 
actually erased. If the phrase "opposite or inverset'is used it 
may help the pupil underatand the meaning of inverse. It should 
be emphasized that the inverae operation undoes the first 
operation. Some pupils may think that the railure to do an 
operation is the inverse of the operation. For example, to the 
question "What is the inverse of singing?" the pupil may say 
"~otsinging." "~otsinging" is the negation of "singing" and 
Is not the inverse of "singing." In this connection it is 
Important to point out that some operations have no inverse. 

Some discussion of a . x = b may be helpful to many 
students. The following questions may be suggestive, 

1. What operation Is indicated by a 
x? 

2. What operation will undo multiplication? 

3. What is the inverse of multiplication? 
4. To undo a 
x, do we divide a 
x by a or a 
x 
by x? (Since a . x means a times x we divide by 
a, the multiplier.) 

5. .How do we undo 3 -2? 8 x 4? Divide 6 by 3; divide 
32 by 8? 
6. In terms of these symbols, can you define dfvision? 
An understanding of a -x = b will be helpful to the pupll as 
he studies percenGage, and the equivalence of the two statements 
"b + a = and "a . x = b" will be of great importance in 

Chapter 6. Therefore, an emphasis on understanding the relation-
ship between a, x, and b is desirable.

3-80 -The Number -One. 
PaKe &. In tNs lesson emphasla should be placed not only on 
special properties of the operations with 1 but also on the 
closure, associative and commutative properties. The fact that 
there is more than one way to represent the number 1 ia empha-
sized in the first exercise. Of course this gives the teacher 
an opportunity to review the concept of numeral as a name for a 
number and not the number itself. Pupils think of the operation 
with numbers so frequently that they forget that (4 -3) is 
really another way to represent 1. 

A class discussion of the lesson summary In symbols may be 
profitable for many pupils. Of course some other letter in place 
of C could be used as practice for pupils in translating symbols 
into words. Be sure that the pupils have the ideas before 
attempting symbolism. Pupilat translations of the mathematical 


sentences could be somewhat as follows: 

(a) The counting numbers (c) are obtained by starting 
wlth 1 and repeatedly adding 1. 
(b) If any counting number Is multiplied by I, the product 
is the same number. 
(c) If any counting number is divlded by 1, the quotient 
is the same counting number. 
(d) If any counting number is divided by the same number, 
the quotient is 1. 
(e) The number one, raised to any power which is a counting 
number, equals 1.

3-9. The Number Zero. 
Pa~ex.The purpose of this lesson is to understand why we can 
or cannot perform the fundamental operations with zero. 

It is important for pupils to understand that zero is a 
perfectly good number and that it does not mean "nothing." The 
pupil should see that, In addition and subtraction, zero obeys 
the same laws as the counting nmbera. 

In explaining the product of c . 0 and 0 . c, It may be 
helpful to review briefly the meaning of multipllcatlon. Such 
discussion questions might be: 

1. What is another way to find the answer to 3 x 5? 
2. What does 3 x 5 mean? It means 5 + 5 + 5 and not 
3 +3 +3 4-3 +3* 
3. Make up a real problem using 3 x 5. he price of 3 
pencils at 5$ each.) 
4. What does 5 x 3 mean? (1t mema 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3.) 
5. Make up a real problem using 5 x 3. h he price of 5 
pencils at 3$ each.) 
After such questlon4, zero may be Introduced In the discussion 
as multiplicand and multiplier, since 5 a O = 0 


5 by the 
commutative property for multiplication. 
In case of division, puplls should understand why we divide 
0 by a and do not divide a by 0. It may be desirable to 
use several examples so that the pupils will see that should 
be 0 and % is not the name of any whole number. 

Some or the pupils may be interested in why we do not define 
or some other number. They should understand that it

% = 1 

would be out of harmony with the fact that zero times any number 
equals zero. 
The translations Into words of the symbolic statements 
concerning zero can be somewhat as follows: 

(a) If zero is added to any whole number, the sum is the 
same whole nmber. 
(b) If any whole number Is added to zero, the sum is the 
same whole number. 
(c) If zero is subtracted from any whole number, the differ-

ence is the same whole number. 

(d) If any whole number is multiplied by zero, the product 
is zero. 
(e) If zero is multiplied by any whole number, the product 
is zero. 
(f) If the product of any two whole numbers is zero, then 
one of the whole numbers Is zero or both are zero. 
(g) If zero is divided by any counting number, the quotlent 
is zero. 
(h) Zero cannot be used as a divisor.

Chapter 4 

NON-METRIC GEOMETRY 

The principal objectives of this chapter are threefold: 

(1) To introduce pupils to geometric ideas and ways of 
thought, 

(2) To give pupils some familiarity with the terminology 
and notatlon of "sets" and geometry, and 
(3) To encourage precision of language and thought. 
There is an attempt to guide the student to the discovery of 
unifying concepts as a basis for learning some of the more specif-
ic details. This chapter forms a background for Chapters 7, 9, 
and 10, which deal with metric or dfstance properties. It attempts 
to focua attention on ideas whlch are fundamental but whlch (while 
sometimes vaguely taken for granted) are often poorly understood 
by students. 

Traditionally, these ideas have been taught when they were 
needed for a particular geometric discussion. But, all too often 
the teacher has assumed that these properties are obvious or clear 
without mentioning them. Also, there should be some advantage in 
considering together this group of closely related analagous 
properties and observing relations among them. The higher level 
study of some aspects of non-metric geometry has become a separate 
mathematical discipline mown as projective geometry. 

Readinq the ~cxt. This chapter has been written with the 
intent that it be carefully read by students. We suggest that not 
only should students be aasigned to read the material, but that 
they also be encouraged to study it. Reading mathematics is not 
like reading a novel. Students may find it necessary to "get in 
and digt'for ideas. Aft;er Section 4-2, students should be advised 
to read with a paper and pencil at hand so that they may draw 
diagrams to assist their understanding. 

Precision -of Langua~e. Pupils should be encouraged to ex-
press themselves accurately. Some pupils will be able to do much 
better than others. 


Spatial Perception. It has been our effort here to help 
boys and girls develop spatial understanding, We do this In 
part by representations -inspace. We hope that suggestions given 
to the students and the notes here may be helpful in selecting 
other representations appropriate for your class. Thls course is 

-not a 12th grade course. It Is intended to provide background 
which is sometimes assumed in later courses. 
Testinq. In testing, try to test for grasp of ideas, not 
for mere recall. Students should be encouraged to express Ideas 
in thelr own words. Because abilities in geometric perception 
and understanding differ from abilities in arithmetic, you may 
observe some redistribution of high and low grades among your 

Time Schedule. The following time schedule is suggested: 

1st week Sections 1 through 4 

2nd week Sections 5 through 7 or 8 

3rd week Remainder of chapter including test 

evaluation. 
High ability classes may do the chapter in 11 days including 
the test. 

Each section was conceived as a one-day section. It seems 
possible that Sections 3 and 5 may take 2 days each and that an 
extra day or so might be spread over Sectlons 8, 9, 10. We 
believe all sections are Important. We have tried to order the 
sections so that the ideas do not become more difficult. In fact, 
the second half of the chapter which deals less with spatial 
perception may well be easier for some students. Some students 
will particularly enjoy Sections 8 and 10. If a class is under 
great time pressure, Section 9 might be omitted. If so, it 
should be assigned to all the better students. 

Materials, 

Inslghts lnto Ideas developed in this chapter will be greatly 
enhanced by use of instructional devices. Encourage students to 
make simple models as a means of helping in basic understandings. 
hphasize ideas, not evaluation of models. As in usfng any 


instructional material of this kind, seek understanding of ideas 

without over-dependence upon representations. 

Sqxested Materials: 

String--to represent lines in space. 
Paper--to represent planes, and folded to represent 
lines and intersections of planes. 
Tape or tacks for attaching string to walls, floor, 
other points in the room. 
Model (as illustrated) 

Suggest making the model as shown above by using a card-
board carton (or, it can be-made with heavy paper, 
oak tag, screen wire). Cut away two sides so that 
only 2 adjacent sides and bottom of box remain. 
String, WIT, may be used to extend through

etc. 

and beyond sides,I' "floor," etc. 
Oak tag for making models to be used by both teacher 

and students. 
Coat-hanger wire, knitting needles, pickup sticks. 
Sclsaors, colored chalk. 
Light-weight paper (for tracing In exercises). 
Yardstick or meter stick with several lengths of string

tied to it at different intervals. fastenfng 
stick to wall, lines may be represented by holding 
the string taut. gatherfng together the free 
end8 at one point the plane containing the point 
and the yardstick may be shown. 

Optional: 

Long pointer for seeing lines. 
Tinker-Toys for bullding models. 
Toothpicks for student models. 
Saran wrap, cellophane, and wire frame for representing 

planes. 


4-1. Points, Lines and Space.

-J -

Page 105. 

I. Understandings; 
(a) A point has no size. 
(b) A line is a certain set of points. 
(c) A line is unlimited in extent. 
(d) Through two points there is one and only one llne. 
(e) Space Is a set of points. 
2. Teaching Suagestions: 
Just as we use representations to develop the concept of the 
I1 counting numberst1 (2 cars, 2 people, 2 hands, 2 balls, 2 chairs, 
etc., to develop the concept of twoness) similarly we must select 
representations for developing the concepts of point, line, plane, 
and space. 

Point. Identify things which suggest the idea of a point 
keeping in mind that one suggestion by itself is not adequate for 
developing the Idea of a point. One needs to use many IllustraUms 
in different situations. Suggestions: tip or pencil, needle, 
pointer; collection of boxes, putting one inside another and 
always being able to place one more inside of the last and 
the point indicated as being in all the boxes; pupil of the eye 
in Intense brightness; progressive closure of shutter of camera; 
dot or light on some TV screens; particle of' dust in the air. 

Llne. Identify two points using some of the situations a8 
above, such as tips of two pencils, etc. Bring out the idea that 
given these two point8 there are many other points on the line 
that contain them. Some of these are between the two points, some 
are "beyond1'the one, and some are "beyond" the other. Also, 
through two points there can be only one llne. The llne hae no 
thickness and no width. It is considered to extend indefinitely. 
Use string held taut between two points to show representations of 
lines in positions that are horizontal, vertical, and slanting. 
Each student may repre~entlines by using a pencil between Ns 
fingertips. With each example talk about thinking of a line as 
unlimited in extent. Rnphaslze frequently that we use the word, 
IIllne, !I to mean atralght line. Identie other repreeentationa of 


lines such as: edge of tablet (holding tablet in various posi-
tions); edge of desk; vapor trails; edges of roof of building; 

etc. It 5s important to select illustrations representing lines 

In space as well as the usual representations made by drawing on 

chalkboard and paper. 

Space-. Models will be most helpful here. Using $8 string on 
yardstick" and considering some point on a table, desk, or on 
some object which all students can see, let all the representatims 
of lines from the yardstick pass through the point. Also, use 
string to show representations of other lines from other points 
on different walls, the floor, etc., all passing through the 
point. Use the model as described in drawing under "Suggested 

ater rials .I' Pass lines (string, wire, thread) through "walls" 
and "floor" to suggest infinite number of lines and that these 
lines extend indefinitely. Bring out the idea that each line 
is a set of points, and that space is made up of all the points 
on all such lines.

Planes. 

Page 108. 

1. Understandinqs. 
(a) A plane is a set of points in space. 
(b) If a line contains twa different points of a plane, it 
lies in the plane. 
(c) Many different planes contain a particular pair of 
points. 

(d) Three points not exactly in a straight llne determine 
a unique plane, 
2. teach in^ Suggestions. 
Identim surfaces in the room rrhich suggest a plat&--walls, 
tops of desks, windows, floor, sheet of paper, piece of cardboard, 
chalkboard, shadow. Make use of Saran wrap, cellophane, and a 
wire frame to show further a representation of a plane since this 
more nearly approaches the rnathematicianrs idea of a plane. Wlth 
each example bring out the idea that a plane has no boundaries, 
that it is flat, and extends Indefinitely. It is an "fdeal" of 
a situation Just as is a llne and a point. We try to give this 
Idea by suggesting things that represent a plane. It is impor-
tant to suggest repreaentations of planes in horizontal, vertical, 
and slanting posltlons. Note that if a llne contains 2 points of 
a plane, it lies in the plane and that many planes may be on a 
particular pair of points as pages of a book, revolving door, etc. 

Then using three fingers or sticks of different heights in 
sets of 3 (not in a straight line) as 
suggested by the sketch at the right, 
see what happens when a piece of card-

Mails or 
board is placed on them. Add a fourth Darning needles 
finger or a fourth stick and observe 
what happens. 
Each student may try this experi-
ment by using three fingers of one hand 
(and also three fingers using both 
hands) Letting a plane be represented 


by a book, piece of oak tag, card. Change position of fingers 
and thumb by bending the wrlst (changing sticks in model). Ask 
class to make a statement about three points not in a stralght 

line (Property 3). 

Demonstrate with wires or string the ideas in the last para-
graph before asking students to read it or suggest that one or 
two students be responsible for demonstrating the idea to other 
members of the class. 

The Class Discussion Problems may well be developed as a 


class activity. 

A note. What is a basic motivation for the study of geometrgr! 
In our dally living we are forced to deal with many flat surfaces 
and with things like flat surfaces. It would be foolish not to 
note similarities of these objects. So, we try to note them. In 
so doing we try to abstract the notion of flat surface. We try 
to find properties that allflat surfaces have. Thus, we are led 
to an abstraction of the flat surface--% geometric plane. We 
study two aspects of this--(l) What a plane is like, considered 
by itself (plane geometry), and (2) how various planes (flat 
surfaces) can be related in space (one aspect of spatial geometry). 

Just how do we study the geometric plane? We study it by 
thinking of what the plane is supposed to represent, namely, a 
flat surface, However, in trying to understand a plane (or 
planes), we find it difficult to think just abstractly. Thus, 
we think of representations of the plane--wall, chalkboard, paper, 
etc., and we think of these as representations of the abstract 
idea. The abstract idea enables us to identify characteristics 
which all flat surfaces have in common.

4-4. Intersection of Sets. 
Page 122. 

1. Understandin~s. 
(a) A set contains elements which are collected according 
some common property or explicit enumeration. 
(b) The common elements in two or more sets make up the 
elements of the intersection of two or more sets. 
2. Teaching Sumestions. 
Review the idea of sets by asking students to descrlbe 
certain sets, as set of names of members of the class, the set 
of members of the class, set of a11 students in class whose last 
name begins with "B", set of even numbers, set of counting numbers 
between 12 and 70 having a factor 7 (i.e. 14,21, 28, .,.). 

&plain that any 2 sets determine a set which Is called their 
Intersection, that is, the set of elements (if any) which are in 
both sets. Have students give the intersection for the set of 
odd numbers between 1 and 30 and the set of counting numbers 
having the factor 3 between 1 and 30. Note the three sets--the 
two given sets and the intersection of the two sets. Use other 
illustrations such as set of boys in the class and the set of 
students with brown eyes. Also find intersection of three sets--
students in class having blonde hair, students in class having 
birthdays in November, and students In class riding the school 
bus. In selecting sets, include some in geometry (i.e. the 
intersection of two lines in the same plane, etc. ). 

Note that the empty set is the iqtersection of two sets with 
no elements in common, Call pupils' attention to the meaning of 

[pages 119-1221 


"common" as it is used here. 
After developing the idea of Intersection go back to examples 
and describe how the idea can be expressed in symbols. It is a 
. coda we can use and like many codes it simplifies the expression. 

For example, 
Set A = (3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25 2% 291 
Set B = {3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 273 

A~B= 13, 9, 15, 21, 273 

You may wish to refer to the supplementary unit on "sets." 
It will provide kulther symbolism for better students and/or 
those who especially enjoy using symbols.

(a) Two lines may: 
(1) be in the same plane and intersect; 
(2) be In the same plane and not intersect (intersect 
in the empty set); 
(3) not be in the same plane and not intersect (lnter-
sect in the empty set), 
(b) A llne and a plane may: 
(1) not intersect (intersect in the empty set); 
(2) intersect in one point; 
(3) intersect in a line. 
(c) Two different planes may 
(1) intersect and their intersection will be a line; 
(2) not intersect (have an empty intersection). 
2. teach in^ Suggestions. 
Use models in order to explore the possible situations for 
two lines intersecting and not intersecting. (kt each student 
have materials, too.) Also, use a pencil or some other object to 
represent a lfne, and a card to represent a plane. Use two pieces 
of cardboard each cut to center with the two fitted together to 
represent the idea of two planes and their intersection, and, 
from these, state some generalizations that may be made.

1. Understandings. 
(a) If A, B, and C are three points on a line, our 
intuition tells us which point is between the other two. 
(b) A line segnent is determined by any two points and Is 
on the line containing those points. 
(c) The two points which determine a segment are called 
endpoints of the segment. 
(d) A line sepent is a set of points which consists of 
Its endpoints and all points between them. 
(e) The union of two sets consists of all the elmenee of 
the two sets. 

2. teach in^ Suggestions. 
Bring out the idea that when we draw a sketch or a picture 
of a line, we draw a picture of one part of the llne, and that 
this is, properly, a line segment. However, we often represent 
a line by a part of a llne (since we cannot do anythlng else). 
One should be careful to say that the sketch represents a line 
or line see~nentas is appropriate. Draw a representation of a 
llne on the chalkboard and name two points of the line, A and 

B. Note that means points A and B and all points between 
them. Name other points on the line and various line segments. 
Review the idea of intersection of two sets. Then develop 
the idea of union of two sets using line segments much as is 
suggested by student text. mtend this idea by selecting other 
illustrations, as, set of girls in class and set of boys in class 
and that the union of the two sets is the set obtained by combfn-
lng the two sets. Each member of the union is then either a boy 
or a girl in the class. Have students suggest other sets, noting 
what can be said about the elements of the union of the two or 
more sets. Take illustrations from geometry too, such as, the 
union of two lines, line and plane, etc. Again note that if an 
element is a member of both sets, it appears only once In their 
union.

This aection gives an unusually good opportunity to emphasize 
relations among point, line, plane, and apace. You can expect 
seventh grade students particularly to enjoy thls section. It 
gives a certain structure to geometry. 

Draw 8 number of lines on the chalkboard. Mark points on 
them and talk about half-lines, rap, and endpoints. Talk about 
the intersection of 2 rays, two half-lines, and ray and half-line.

in common.

(d) A triangle determines its angles but does not contain 
its angles. 
2. Teaching Suffqestions. 
Illustrate the idea of angle as two rays with the same end-
point. Use colored chalk to show interior and exterior. Also 
note how we name an angle. (This is not the only way to consider 
an angle. This definit-ion, however, Is identical with that which 
Is very likely to be used in the loth grade, Later, the measure 
of an angle and angle as a rotatlon will be considered.) 

In developing the idea of triangle, put three pofnts on 
board and note them as endpoints of 3 line segments, m, E,m. 
Note the set of' points in each segment and that a triangle is the 
union of these three sets. Use colored chalk tb show interior 
and exterior, lhphasize the set of points of the interior, the 
exterior, and that of the triangle. 

Again students may be interested in drawing angles, triangles, 
shading, etc. h his is not perspective drawing.) This Is good 
material to develop imagination and to encourage drawing,etc. 
How many triangles can be drawn with just four lines? How many 

[pages 137-138] 


wlth four lines two of which are parallel? Etc. 
In discussing the angles of the triangle bring out the idea 

: that although people often talk about angles of a triangle, It Is 
a short way of saying that they are the angles determined by the 
triangle. Use such analogies as the school determines its gradu-
ates but graduates are not In school; a city "hasttsuburbs, but 
the suburbs are not part of the clty, etc.

4-9, One-to -one Correspondence. 
Page 142. 

Understandings. 

(a) The idea of one-to-one correspondence is fundamental in 
counting. (chapter 3) 
(b) One-to-one correspondences in geometry can be establi&ed: 
(1) Between a certain set of lines and a certain set 
of points 
(2) Between the set of points of one sepent and the 
set of points of another segment 
(3) Between certain other geometric sets in pairs. 
[pages 140-1421 

95 

2. Teaching Sw~estions, 
Review the idea of one-to-one correspondence and the neces-
sary condition that for each element In set A there corresponds 

1 

an element in set B. For example, if there are 5 chalrs and 
5 people, for each chair there is a person and for each p=?son 
there Is a chair. 

I 
I 
This idea, while elementary, Is sometimes hard to grasp. 
One-to-one correspondences between finite sets (sets having a 
specific number of elements as in the illustration above) are 
easy to observe If they exlst. If sets A and B are finite, 
then if A and B have the same number of elements, there exlsts 
a one-to-one correspondence between them. Such follows simply by 
counting. But we are sometimes interested in a particular one 
of the possible one-to-one correspondences. 'For the two congruent 
triangles below we are interested In matching A with D, B 

congruence. If we were to match A with F, B with D, and 
C with E we would not be noting the congruence. 
For infinite sets H and K we may be interested in two 
aspects: 

(1) Is there any one-to-one correspondence between H and K? 
(2) Is there a "nice1'or llnatural"one-to-one correspondence? 
In the examples In Section 4-9, we not only show that there 
is some one-to-one correspondence but that there is a "natural" or 
Hnice" one. There also would be a great many that are not "naturd" 
or "nice." 

To establish a one-to-one correspondence we need (1) a 
complete matching scheme, and (2) in this particular device It 
myst be true that for any element of either aet there corresponds 
a unique element of the other set. It is implied by what we say 
that if -a corresponds to 2, then -b corresponds to -a. 


In effect, to establish a one-to-one correspondence we must 
have a way of II tying" each element of either set to a particular 
element of the other. And the "atring" we use for tying -a to 

-b also ties 2 to -a. 
In the text we describe a one-to-one correspondence between 
a certain set of lines and a certain set of Points. 
Problems 2 and 3 (Ikepclse 4-9-b) are developmental and 
becauae of this are suggested for possible classwork.

exterior). 
(d) If a point A is in the Interior of a curve and a point 
B Is in the exterior of the curve, then the lntersectlcn

2. Teaching Suggestions. 
Draw some curves on the chalkboard, bringing out the idea 
that we call them "curves" and that a segment is just one kind 
of curve. We use the word "curve" in a special way in mathe-
matics. 

Note that a slmple closed curve separstes a plane Into two 
aets and that the curve itself Is the boundary of the two aets. 
Also, that any quadrilateral, parallelogram or rectangle is a 
simple closed curve. Identify some of the many curves which are 
suggested in the room, such as boundary of chalkboard, total 
boundary of floor surface, etc. 

Students enjoy drawing elaborate curvea which may still be 
classified as slmple closed curves. Encourage their drawing a 
few simple closed curves for a bulletin board exhibit.

FACTORING AND PRrnS 

. 5-1. PrZmes. 
Page -151. It is important that in the beginning the pupils 
experiment with numbers and at the same time become accustomed 
to the equivalent terms "divisible by" and "multiple of." To 
emphasize this and to give the initial development of the Sieve 
of Eratosthenes, the pupil is first asked to cross out the 
multiples of 2, except for 2 itself, in the list of numbers 
up to 31; then the multiples of 3. 
Page 152. As a class exercise, the Sieve for the numbers up to 
100 Is to be constructed. It will save class time for the teacher 
to have prepared on ditto sheeta the numbers from 1 to 100 
arranged in rows of ten. If the teacher wishes, the next hundred 
numbers might also be included. The pupils should check their 
copies carefully and keep them for future reference. 

It should be stressed that 1 is a special number in various 
ways. First, every counting number is divisible by 1. Second, 
1 ia divialble only by itself, that is, It has only one factor. 
Because of these properties, the unique factorization theorem, 
introduced in Section 2 of this chapter, would not hold if 1 
were classified aa a prime number. 

In constructing the Sleve the students should realize that 
after crossing out the multiples of 2 (except for 2) only the 
odd numbers remain, that is, only those numbers which are not 
divisible by 2. After the aecond step, only the numbers 
1, 2, 3 and those not divisible by either 2 or 3 remain. 
After the third step, only the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5 and those not 
divisible by 2, 3, or 5 remain. After the fourth step, only 
the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and those not divisible by 2, 3, 5 or 7 
remain. This pattern contfnues. 

The students are encouraged to try to see why in the fifth 
step, involving multiples of 11, no further numbers are crossed 
out in the set from 1 to 100. Zf no student dfscovers why 


this Is so, the teacher should pass over the point since it is 

important that it be discovered in the student's own time; but 

some student may notice that any number less than 100 which is 

not a prime number must have a factor which is less than the 

aquare root of 100. Prom this it follows that, except for 1, all 
the numbers remaining In this Sieve after the fourth step will 
be prime numbers. The fourth step is the crossing out of all 
multiples of 7 other than 7.

5-2. Factors. 
The purposes of this section are to develop understandings of 
the terms "factor, " "camplete factorization,It "composite number, 

I' 

and of the Unique Factorization Property. Notice that the 
definition of factor includes zero; thus zero has factors. 
Problem 4 of Exercises 5-2 serves as a basia of a discussfon 
of zero. 
Page 157. We do not consider it mandatory that pupils use 
exponents. They should be encouraged, however, to use them where-
ever it is reasonable to do so. 

As a matter of interest, the Unlque Factorization Property 
is usually referred to as the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. 
Notice that in complete factorization for a prime number 
like 17 only one factor is written, as: 17 = 17. 

The definition given of a composite number is felt to be 
the easleat to understand of various possible ones. Some teachers 
may prefer to stress the definitions in terms of number of factors 
since this does have some unifying effect. If this is the case, 
the counting numbers would be classified as follows: 

a. The number 1 which has just one factor, namely, Itself. 
b. The prlme numbers which have just two factors; namely, 
1 and the number Itself 
c. The composite numbers which have more than two factors. 
[pages 154-1571 

It Is important to notice that every counting number comea under 
one of theae headings. 

Notice that the definition is given of complete 
factorization, not* complete factorization, since the order 
of the prime factors may vary. 

fn the previous edition of this section, diagrams of 

numbers were considered in connection with factoring. Teacher 
reaction was mixed, some finding it very useful and others 
of no assistance at all. Teacher ~eactlonsseem to indicate 

that aome students acqulre better understanding of factorleation 
by use of theae diagrams, others are confused by them. Since 
also it was felt that the development of this method might be 
eaeler if the teacher was not bound by a text, we are confining 
the description of this method to the teacher's commentary. 

EBsAcally, we can represent a product by the diagram 
2 3 6 
Oh0 where the 3 aaaociated with the line is the 
multiplier, which "takes 2 into 6. " The arrow indicates the 
direction in which the multiplication goea. 
2 6 24

3 4

Similarly o ,O o represents the product 
(2x 3) x 4. 

Wen the three different complete lactorlzations of 18 could 
be represented by the following dlagram. Notice that all the 
factors of 18 also appear in the diagram 

In making a diagram you may suggest to the pupils that it Is 
beat first to make a list of all the factors of the number and to 
arrange them from the smallest to the largeat. For 12 this would 
be 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Then start with 1 and continue to build a 
chain so that the second number is divisible by the preceding nun-


ber, and so on. Thus, one chain would consist of 1, 2, 4, and 
12; another chain would consist of 1, 3, 6, and 12; and the last 
chain would be 1, 2, 6, and 12. In eech of these chains, taking 
any pair, the second is divisible by the firat and there Is no 
factor between them. We could not go from 1 to 4 alnce there 
is the factor 2 between 1 and 4. Remember that one of the 
rules of the game is that there may be no other factor between 

successive numbers. 

The diagrams for the numbers from 1 through 20 are 
ahown here : 


Some teachers may be interested in pursuing the investigation 
of theae diagrams a little further. TAe following examples are 
included for this purpose. Also, a few of your very gifted pupils 
may gain better understandings about numbers from these examples. 
However, it is felt that if presented to all students, the extra 
time used nay not justify the results.

9. Divisibility is a property of number. It is the number whick 
is divisible by another number. The numeral is a way of writ 
ing the number. In base ten, a numeral which represents an 
even number ends with an even niunber; in base five this Is 
not necessarily so. This is illustrated in Exercise 8. 
+lo, Some of the items in the table will be :

numbers. The third perfect number is 496. 

5-3. Divisibility. 
Page 160. The purpose of this section is to facilitate the 
discovery of factors of numbers by inspection of the decimal 
system numerals which represent them. Since we need be concerned 
only with prime factors, we confine ouraelvea chiefly to 2,3 
and 5. At this point in the pupil's development It was felt that 
the discovery of patterns would be more meaningful than the 
discussion dissecting the numeral according to the powers of 
ten. Some teachers may prefer the treatment in the supplementary 
unit on divisibility since it gives a little more insight into 
the reasons back of these patterns. 

It is hoped that most of the pupils will go a little further 
than merely seeing that as far a8 the table goes, every number 
divisible by 3 has a sum of digits which is als~divisible by 3. 
They should look at the transition where the tens digit increases 
by 1, as is suggested In Problem 3. Some may be able to go 
further and see that where the hundreds digit increases by 1, 
the tens digit decreases by 9 and the unit digit by 7, leaving 
a net decrease of 9 + 7 -1 = 15 which is a multiple of 3. 
Some pupils may even go further and notice that if one takes the 
sum of the digits, the same properly holds. 

It ia not intended that great stress shall be laid here on 
tests for divisibility in other bases but It Is very important 
that the pupils realize that the te sts given here depend on the 
way the number is written (that is, the aystem of numeration 

[page 1601

used). Just a little discussion of tests for other number systems 
seems to be the best way to emphasize this point.

4. For divisibility by 5 one needs only to see that when 5 is 
added to a number whose unfta digit is 0, the sum has units 
digit 5; if 5 is added to a number whose units digit is 5, 
the sum has units digit 0. %is pattern repeats to show 
the test for all numbers. 
5. The following table can be made for multiples of 9: 
Multiple of 9 9 18 rl 36 45.. -90 99 id... 
Sum of digits 9 9 9 9 99189 
6. A counting number will be divisible by 6 if and only if It is 
divlaible by both 2 and 3. Hence the test is that it must 
be even and the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. 
7. If a number is divisible by 15 it must be divisible by both 
3 and 5, and conversely. Hence the test 1s that Its laet 
; 

digit must be one of 0 and 5 and the sum of its digits must 
i be a multiple of 3. 

8. a. Since the last digit ia odd, the number is odd. 
b. 'ihe number 1s 400 in the decimal system and hence Is 
even. The brlght pupil might notice that the number 
3 2

is even since it can be written in the form 7 + 7 + 7+1 
which is the sum of an even number of odd numbers. 

c. Here the number in the decimal system 1s 259 which is 
odd. The bright student might notice that it may be 
3

written 6 + 62 + 6 + 1 which is the sum of 1 and 
three even numbera; hence is odd. 


d. Here the number in the decimal system la 40 which is 
even; or it may be shorn even by the same kind of 
argument as in part b. 
9. If a number is written in the system to the base seven, its 
last digit is zero if and only if it is divisible by seven, 
but it need not be divisible by ten. To test divisibility 
by 3 write the first few multiples of three in the 
system to the base seven as follows: 
Number to the base seven 3 6 12 15 21 24 30 33 36 42 
Sum of the digits 36 3 6 3 6 3 612*6 
"Notice that 12 is also written in the system to the base 
seven. Here when the first digit increases by 1, the 
second digit decreases by 4 giving a net decrease of 3. Hence 
the same test for divisibility by 3 works both in the 
decimal system and in the system to the base seven. 
10, If a number is written in the number system to the base twelve 
and has zero as Its last digit it must be divisible by 12 
but need not be divisible by 10. It will be divisible by 
if its last digit Is one of 0,3,6,9. This may be shown In 
the same way that we tested for divisibility by 5 in the 
decimal system, since the pattern 3,6,9,0 repeats in the 
sequence of multiples of 3 written to the base twelve. 

11. A number written to the base seven will be divfsible by 6 if 
the sum of its digits is divislble by 6. This is apparent 
from the table given for exercise 9 if we notice that every 
other sum of digits Is even, 
12. A number written in the decimal system will be divisible by 
4 if -one of the following holds : 
a. the last digit is one of 0,4,8 and the tens digit is even. 
b. the last digit is 2 or 6 and the tens digit 1s odd. 
This can be seen from the pattern in which the muLtlples 
of 4 fall. Also, since any multiple of 100 is divislble 
by 4, we could also say that a number is divisible by 4 
if the number represented by the last two digits is divisible 
by 4.

5-4. Greatest Common Factor. 
The following skills and understandings should be developed 
through this aectlon : 

1. To identify the common factors of several numbers. 
2. To find the greatest common factor of several numbers in 
two ways--by listing the factors of each and by using a 
complete factorization of each number. 
It is recommended that the abbreviation (G.c.F.) not be 
used in thls section. Use the complete phrase "greatest common 
factor" in order to fix the meaning of the concept in the minds 
of the pupils. 

Explain that if something is "common" to several things, then 
one meaning is that they are similar in some way. If two numbers 
have a certain number as a factor, we say that factor Is common 
to both. 

Provide drill on finding the greateat common factor by listing 
all factors to ensure that pupfls have a thorough understanding 
of the meaning of the term. Some students may discover the method 
of finding the greatest common factor by complete factorization 
before it is introduced in problem 14, but if they do not dlscover 
it, do not "push" them into this prematurely. Students should 
be encouraged to use "short divisioni' when the divisor is less 
than ten. 

Discussion Exercises 5-4. Page 166. 

14-16. Method -of fin din^ -the Greateat Common Factor & 
Complete Factorization, This is a procedure for computing the 
greatest common factor but it is not intuitive. The method of 
the definition (listing all the factors, etc. ) should be used 
in class until the concept is fixed in the minds of the pupils, 

Illustration of Method: Find the greatest common factor of 

24 and 60. 
First, find a complete factorlzatlon of each number: 
24=23 x3 

2

60=2 ~3x5 


The factor 2 occurs three times in the complete factorlzation of 
24 and twice for 60; hence, 2 can occur at most twice for 60; 
hence, 2 can occur at most twice in any factor common to both 24 
and 60. The factor 3 occurs just once in each, and hence can 
occur at most once in any common factor. The number 5 is not 
a factor of 24, and hence cannot occur In any common factor. 
Hence the greateat common factor is z2 x 3 -12. Notice that 
the power of each prime factor of the greatest common factor is 
the smaller of the powers to which it occurs in the two given 
numbers. 

Surmhary -of Nethod: (1) Find a complete factorization of 
each number. (2) Pick out the primes which occur in -all (every 
one) of these factorizations, (3) For each prime picked In (2), 
write the -smallest power of it which occurs in any of the factor-
izations. (4) Multiply all the powers written in (3); this 
product is the greatest common factor. 

The pupils will find it easier to pick out the primes and ex-
ponents in steps (2)and (3) above if the original numbers are 
written in a column with the complete factorization of each 
number to the right of the number. 

16. h. This exercise gives the pupils an opportunity to 
establish a procedure for searching for factors of numbers 
when they cannot guess them. It is time consuming, and 
may be omitted if time is not avaflable for it. 
In factoring 1173, remfnd the pupils of the test for 
divisibility by 3 and obtain 1173 = 3 x 391. Far the 
number 391, we try the successfve primes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 
17, to find 391 = 17 X 23. Review the reasons for trying 
only the primes--i.e. for skipping 9, 15, and all the even 
numbers except 2. Point out that, since 20 20 = 400 
is larger than 391, it is only necesadry to try the primes 
less than 20 (391 cannot be the product of two factors each 
of which Is larger than 20). In general, if the prlrnes 
are tried in order of magnftude, one should stop when the 

quotient is less than or equal to the divfaor..

55 Remainders -in Division. 

This eectlon serves a dual purpose: to help review basic 
understandings about division and to separate the section dealing 
with greatest common factor andleast common multiple. 

Also, this sectfon should help strengthen the pupils1 ideas 
concerning divisibility. Weusethe idea of the kclidean 
division algorithm, but wedo not introduce the term "algorithm." 

[pages 168-1691 


It I8 not necessary to confuse pupils with terms not needed in 
understanding the basic ideas hi8cussed. 

Page 170. The divfaion relation should be discussed following 
the introductory work and review. It is Important that the 
pupil understand the relationships among a, b, q, and R 

lntheexpreesion a= (b 

q) +R. If careisused to 
relate the~esymbols with the terms dividend, diviaor, quotient, 
and remafnder, the pupil should not find it difficult to use 
the symbol fom with understanding. 
The pupil should understand that division always involves 
a remainder. We may not always write a zero remainder, but the 
importance of recognizing zero as a remainder should not be 
minimized. It should be pointed out to students that when the 
remainder 16 zero we can use the division relation to express 
divisibility.

i 9. a. Consider first two of the lines. Since they are different 
lines and are not parallel, they 
intersect in exactly one point as 
sketched, !he third line either goes through this point 
of intersection or it doesn't. The two cases are illus-
trated belaw,

b. c. In part a ,we discussed the cases where no two of 
the lines are parallel; these two cases are also possible 
in parts b and c. We have left to consider the caae 
where at least two lines -are parallel. The third line 
is either parallel to both of them or to nelther of them. 
me two cases are illustrated below. 
b, 2 intersections c. 0 lnteraectlons 

19, Since a, b, f, g are four different numbers and g la a 
factor of both a and b, we must have g ( a, g ( b, 
Also, f is a factor of both a and b (different from 

g) and g Is the largest common factor of a and b. 
Thus f < a, f < b and f ( g. Illustrate with a -12 
b = 18, f = 3, g = 6. 
20. If the numbers are allowed to be equal, all four of them 
may be the same so that there may be no Ineguallties among 
them. Illustrate with a = b = f = g = 4, 
22. a. If we conaider the experiment of drawing one piece of 
paper from the hat, there are 50 possible outcomes: the 
numeral drawn could represent any one of 1, 2, 3, ..,, 50. 
Of these 50 outcomes there are five favorable (10, 20, 30, 
40, 50). Thus the probability of a favorable outcome is 
2=J-

50 10' 
b, Of the 50 outcomea, there are 10 which are favorable 
(the numeral drawn represent a number divisible by 5), 
namely: 5, 10 1, . 5. Thus the probability of a 
favorable outcome is lO/5O = l/5. 
The explanation for c and d follows from above. 

23. a. Of the 50 possible outcomes, there are 50 in which 
the numeral drawn represents a number which la divisible 
by 1, namely: 1, 2, 3, ..., 50. Since every numeral 
represents a number divisible by 1, only one draw is 
needed, 

b. For 2, we would have to draw enough times to draw all 
numerals representing numbers not divisible by 2; 
1, 3, 5, ..., 49. There are twenty-five such numerals. 
One more, the twenty-sixth, -must be a number divisible 
by 2. 
c. Of the 50 poaslble outcomes, there are 16 in which the 
numeral drawn mpreaents a number which is divisible by 
3, namely: 3, 6, 9, . . ., 48. To be -sure of drawing at 
leaat one of these numerals, we would have to draw enough 
times to draw all the other numerals and then one more; 
i.e. (50 -16) + 1 = 35 draws. 
24. a. Each of the sets haa eleven elements (or members). One

Least Common Wltiple (L.c.M.) 
Skills and understandings to be developed: 
5-7 

1. To find common multiples of several numbers, 
2, To find the least common multiple of several numbers in 
two ways--by listing the multiples of each and by using 
a complete factorization of each number. 

It is recommended that the abbreviation (L.c.M. ) nof be 
used in this section. Use the complete phrase "least common 
multiple" In order to fix the meaning of the concept in the 
minds of the pupils. 

'Ihe treatment of zero as a multiple must be done carefully. 
mat zero is a multiple of any whole number is introduced here 
so that we may be consistent in the definition of an even 
number, i.e., "a number divisible by 2, " or "a number ending 
in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8." A careful treatment of zero should help 
clarify some of the special properties of zero. 

That the "least common multiple" is the smallest counting 
number la an Important distinction. Otherwise, for any members 
of a set of numbers, the least common multiple will be zero. 
Since zero as a least cmon multiple is not particularly 
useful to us in mathematics we choose to use the least counting 
number in a set of common multiples. Provide drill on finding 
the least common multiple by listing multiples, This provides 
some basic drill in multiplication and division. Problem 13 
Is designed to help students 'tdiscover''a shorter way to find 
the least common multlple. Do not insist on the use of this 
method at this tlme, but encourage the students to use it if they 
understand why it works. 


Method of fl~dingthe Least Common Multiple b~ Complete Factorization.

---. 

&ample: Find the least common multiple of 12 and 18. First 
find a complete factorization of each number: 
12 -22 X 3 

2

18=2x3. 

2

Any number which Is a multiple of 12 must have 2 as a factor 

and also 3 as a factor. Any number which Is a multiple of 18 

2

must have 2 as a factor and aleo 3 as a factor. Thus a 
number which is a common multiple of 12 and 18 must have among 
its factors all of the following: 

2

22, 3, 2, 3. 

2

A number which haa 2 as a factor certatnly has 2 as a factor, 

Slmllarlg, a number which has 32 as a factor certainly has -3

Exercises 5-8. 

The purpose of this section is to swnmarize in general the 
new material Introduced in this chapter. Rather than produce 
a glossary, which might confuse pupils with definitions "out 
of context," we chose briefly to discuss the new terms. 
Attention 1s drawn to the terms which we wish to stress by 
writing them out in capital letters, 

TPle diagram used in the introductory paragraph of this 
section might be discussed in class at some length to assure 
pupils' understanding of the relations among the sets of numbers 
included here, Pupils should understand, for example, that the 
set of prime numbers is a subset of the set of whole numbers 
and a subset of the counting numbers;similarly, for the set of 
composite numbers and the number ''one." They should also under-
stand that the number "zero" is a subset of the whole numbers 
but ia not a subset of the counting numbers, Care should be 
used to explain these ideas. ft is not intended that the word 
If subsets" be introduced, because the ideas Involved in the 
diagram can be discussed wfthout using set terminology. 

Another purpose of this section Is to fix in the pupils* 
minds the differences between the greatest common factor and the 
least common multiple. Note that we have avoided using the 
abbreviations L.C.F. and L.C.M. in the pupilst materials, 

[page 1831 


It is recommended that these abbreviations not be used at this 

time. 
The discussion should emphasize again that the greatest

I 

conunon factor of two different numbers Is Brnaller than one or both

/

i of the numbers. Also, the least common multiple of two different 
1 numbers is greater than one or both of the numbers.

never be greater than the largest number of the set of 
numbers because a factor of a number is always less than 
a multiple of the number unless the multiple is zero. 

c. No. The L.C.M. of the members of a set of numbers can 
never be less than the largest member of the set of 
numbers. 
me least common multiple of two numbers is at least as big 

as the larger of the two numbers (since the L.C,M, is a 

multiple of the larger number). The greatest common factor 

of two numbers is no larger than the smaller of the two 

numbers (since the Q.C.F. is a factor of the smaller number). 
If the least common multiple and greatest common factor are 

equal, the larger and smaller number must also be equal.

Illustrate with 4 and 6, locating the L.C.M. and 

G.C.F. on the number line; then use 4 and 4. 
a. No. It is not possible to have exactly four numbera 
between two odd numbers. Between any two odd primes 
there is alwaye an odd number of numbers. If they 
are consecutive odd primes all the numbers between 
would have to be composite. 
b, Yes. For example, between 23 and 29 there are 
exactly 5 composite numbers; 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. 
a. 135, 222, 783, and 1065 ape all divisible by three. 
b. 222 is the only number divisible by six 
c. 135 and 783 are divisible by nine. 
d. 135 and 1065 are divisible by five. 
e. 135 and 1065 are divisible by fifteen. 
f, None of the numbers are divisible by four. 

Many different answers should be expected from the atudents; 
in a way his reasons for hi8 answer are more important than 
the answer itself. The most obvious answer is that as far 
as multiplication is concerned, the prime numbers are the 
building blocks of all counting numbers, since any counting 
number can be expressed a8 a product of prime numbers. If 
we how a complete factorizatLon of a number, then we can 
find all its factors. Also from complete factorization8, the 

Q.C.F. and L.C.M. of set8 of numbers may also be found. 
BRAINBUSTER, The pattern is a five-pointed star. 

There is no greatest prime number. 

*The following proof ia for the information of the teacher. 
It is not expected that any except the most brilliant 
students would profit by it in the 7th grade* 

To show there is no largest prlme number, we will show 
that If p is any prlme, there is another prlme larger than 

p. Denote by M the product of all the primes less than or 
equal top: M= 2 X 3 X5 X7 X11 X ... Xp, 

men M + 1 Is certainly larger than p and M + 1 has at 

leaat one prime factor (it may be a prime). kt M + 1 

does not have any of the primes 2, 3, 5, 7, ..., p as a 

factor since dlvisfon by any of these primes leaves a 

remainder of 1. Thus all the prlme factora of M + 1 

are larger than p, and hence p ie not the largest prime. 

Since p was an arbitrary prime, there la no largest 
prime.

Chapter 6 

THE RATIONAL NUMBER SYSTEM 
I Overview 
The most important objective of this chapter is to present

It 

the reasons behind the rules for the arithmetic operations of 

i multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction on the set 

i of rational numbera. The student will be able to use these 
rulea correctly and with facility If he fully understands the 
reasons behind them. We reiterate the principle that mathematics 
stresses reason over rote learning and concept over technique. 
At the same time, an equally important goal at thia level is to 
reinforce techniques which the pupil has already learned. These 
two goala should not be incompatible. We are assuming that the 
pupils have already been Introduced to these operations and have 
had some practice In them In an earlier grade. This means that 
they already know what a fraction is--at least in easy situations. 
The seventh grader is probably not ready for a postulation&l 
approach to the study of number systems. The whole numbers and 
the rational numbers are part of nature for him. To speak of 
constructlnq the rational number system from the whole numbers 
would be meaningless at his level, as It would be to speak of 
the problem o definlnkthe operations in this set of numbers.

i

For thia reason we have not stated postulates or definitions-. 
Instead of posing the problem of how to define multiglication 
of rational numbers, for instance, and then building toward 
this definition, we have proposed to the pupil that we examine 
the reasons why multiplication behaves as It does. We try to 
motivate the usual rmle for multlplicatlon, and then state this 
rule clearly and concisely. Instead of treating the commutative, 
associative, and distributive properties as postulates we sfrnply 
point them out and state them clearly early in the discuaaion of 
the operatlone and then use them in subsequent discussion. It 
is hoped that as he follows this treatment the pupil will begin 
to see the skeleton of a mature mathematical approach to number 
eystems without being smothered by the more aubtle ideas which 


are necessary for complete understanding. Do tell your 

pupils, however, that they are really just talking in a very 

naive way about something that is really aomewhat sophisticated. 

The student will probably bring a wealth of terminology and 

calculating procedures with him from the sixth grade. He is 

probably familiar with the terms mixed number, proper fraction, 

improper fraction, declrnal fraction, and lowest terms. We 

suggest that you use the terms that are familtar to you and to 

your students. We have made no attempt to build such a 

vocabulary in this chapter because these terms are not used 

extensively in subsequent mathematics. 

We wish to discourage the indiscriminate use of the 

operations of ''cancellingtt and I' reducing -frattions" . Instead we 

stress the operations of "factoring" and "finding the simplest 

form for a fraction". Thus instead of 

4 

we prefer 

The term "factor" has been used in an earlier chapter. 

Moremoverin ninth grade algebra a student 1s askedbo factor 
2 

x -1. 

We use freely the terminology and concepts developed in 

earlier chapters. Thus the terms factor, prime, greatest common 

factor, least common multiple, ray, and segment are used. 

In order to discuss the arithmetic operations intelligently, 
indeed to tell what the elements of our system of rational 
numbers are, we must first discuss the meaning of a "fractfon" 
and the "equality of fractions". We must point out that a 
fraction is a name for a number and that a number has many names. 
We shall not belabor the dlfference between a number and its 
name. 


Various means are used to describe a rational number--
measures of quantitlea, points on the number line, and quotients 

of whole numbers. We hope that you wlll find that we have 
introduced the number sentence b -x = a in an easy way. We 
realize that students will vary greatly in the amount of abstract 
mathematics they will comprehend. These different approaches 
can be vlewed as three distinct explanations, or each can be 
viewed as an Interpretation of the other. This chapter can 
serve as a bridge from arithmetic to algebra. Our concurrent 
use of the number line and of equations or number sentences is 
Intermediate between a concrete inte~pretationof number and the 
abstract manipulation of number as represented by a symbol in an 
equation. You may want to point out that while piles of sand or 
points on the line are not rational numbers, problems Involving 
them provide motivation for the abstract mathematical definitions 
which create the system of ratlonal numbers. You may also want 
to give more "social-type" exercises and examples. 

All pupils should be able to see that represents the 
number x such that b 


x and to know that a rational
-a 
number Is one which can be written as a quotient of a whole 
number and a counting number. 

In connection with our use of the number sentence, you wlll 
note that the most elaborate equation dlscuaaed is of the form 
ax = b or a + x = b. It Is always the case that x is to 
stand for a number. We are usually seeking a replacement for it, 
either from the set of whole numbers, or from the set of rational 
numbers. The symbol "x" la not to be regarded as a variable. 
In any number sentence or equation, the point is made that we 
have a representation of the same number in two different ways. 
When an operation is performed on thia number, we get the same 
result, no matter which representation is uaed. Thus when an 
operation is performed on both sides of an equality, the equality 
pemains true, although the numbers Involved may be changed. 

You may have other highly auccesaful teaching methods for 
presenting the arithmetic operations with rational numbers, You 
may even have found that equations cannot be introduced in the 


seventh grade. We hope you will try to understand the approach we 
are making here. By simply regarding as the replacement for 
x which makea bx = a true, we think we are able to present 
sound mathematical reasons behind the arithmatfc operations. 
This Is actually the point of view from which fractions are 
introduced traditionally. The number 9 Is what you get when you 
divide 5 into 7 equal parts; this la another way of saying that if 
you take seven of these parts you get 5. It is somewhat analogous 
to answering the question: What was the color of Washlngtonrs 
white home? This way of looking at fractions may be a little 
difficult for the students at the time, especially ff the teacher 
has not tried It before. But It should pay dividends in the long 

run. One such place Is in the introduction of negative numbera 
from an analogous point of view. 

6-1. History -of Fractions 

The hfstorical remarka show that arithmetic concepta were 
Introduced with some difficulty into ancient civilizations. 
Eggptlan and Babylonian fractions provide an opportunity for a 
brief review of the operations you think the students should 
already be able to perform. 

6-2. Rational Numbera 
Two ideas, on which the rest of the chapter depends, ape 
introduced in this section. 

1. Equivalent fractions are merely different names for the 
same number. 
2. x.=t beoause bx = a, b # 0. 
It la felt that the students are well grounded at this atage 

in considering fractions by means of specific examplea, and in 
1

realizing that 3is either of 3 or 3 times k,but that they have I 
had little experience in considering a fraction as the result of 
division, or in divislon aa an inverse operation to multiplication. 


The chapter has been planned to give more practice in these 
concepts, since they are basic as one continues with mathematics. 
Other approaches are easier, but they do not achieve thls result. 
It must be emphasized that the rational number Is the number 
whose product with b Is a, and that a concise way of saying 
this is: 5a is the number x for which bx = a. 

In this section the switch from the arithemtic symbols for 
multiplication and division to those generally used in science 
and mathematics, is made. The symbol 5 x 6 Is now written as 
5 -6 or 5(6), a x b as either a . b or ab, and 5 + 6 

5

as 6. 

Some special comment on the use of the words "fraction" and 
"rational number'' seems in order here. In the text we have tried 
to be very careful to use the word "fraction" only when we refer 

j to a symbol of a certain kind. It is a came for a number. There 

I 

are several reasons for thls. In the first place, we want to refer 
: to the numerator and denominator whlch are parts of a symbol for a 

t 

i number. Thus we can speak of the numerator of a fraction but not 
! the numerator of a number. This reinforces the important idea 

t 

r that a number has many names -some of these names are fractions, 
/ Secondly, we are looking ahead to the time when we shall want to 

I 

I call such things as: 

fractions. 
Thus we write of equal numbers but not of equal fractions. 

2 4

When we write = 6we do not mean that the fractions are equal 
but merely that the numbers which they represent are equal. 
F'ractions which represent the same numbers we call "equivalent1' 
but we usually can avoid thls word. Also, we add and subtract 
numbers but we do not add and subtract fractions. 

Making these distinctions requires great care at times since 
traditionally the word "fraction" is used in both senses, but it 
is felt that such care will avoid confusion now and later, Though 
it is very Important that the text be precise fn this respect, it 

[pages 190-1921 


is probably too much to expect pupils at this stage to exercise 
equal cape in their expression. The teacher will know where 
careful usage will avofd confusion (and there are many such 
places) and where use of "fraction" in both senses will result in 
no dlff iculty .

Properties -of Rational Numbers 
Here it is pointed out by examples that the closure, 
commutative, associative, and identity properties of addition and 
multlplication, and the distributive property of multiplication 
over addition, hold for the rational numbers as well as for the 
whole numbers. Many teachers may find thla an opportune review. 

6 

On the basis of these properties, it is shown that 4and 

repreaent the same number by considering a corresponding problem 
in terns of multlplication. It is not appropriate at this tlme to 

show 3= by saylng $ = 5 2because no method for multiplying

5 2 
fractions has been discussed. 
By generalizing from this example, Property 1 is obtained. 
For selected students you may wish to give an argument for 
Property 1 as follows: 
Let ua now look at the general situation. If a, b, and k 
are whole numbers, b and k not zero, and bx = a, then 

a

x = F. Since bx and a are names for the same number, k(bx), 

(kb)x, and ka are different names for one number. 

(kb)x = ka 
ka

If (kb)x = ka, then x = m. 


The simplest fraction for a rational number is a fraction 
in which the numerator and denominator have no common factor 
except 1. We have continued to call this "the simplest form of 
the fraction" although this presents logical difficulties. By 

10 2

this definition the simplest form for -1s i. When this occurs,

5 
pupils should be encouraged to also write the number as 2. 

Until now pupils may have been urged to always change 
improper fractions to mixed numbers. This is unrealistic. Both 
forms are correct and both forms have their uses. In many 
exercises there are various correct forms for the answer. If a 
student gives an alternative correct form, he should receive full 

cred1t .

64 Recfprocals 
If the product of two rational numbers 18 1, theas numbers 
are called reciprocals of each other. The topic of reciprocals 
is Lntroduced relatively early in the chapter to provide for an 
application of the deflnltfon of rational numbers, additional 
review of skills learned In earlier grades, and in preparation 
for later topics, particularly dlvielon. 
It is assumed that students already know that n 


1 = 1, 

for n +0. Many of them probably would also know that the number 
b

by which would be multiplied to obtain 1 is z. Nevertheless 
it should be profitable for them to review multiplication in these 
special cases Ina setting which emphasizes the definition of a 
rational number. Such review ahould make some of the later 
developments much more meaningfil . 


At this point it seema undesirable to think of the product 


2 since such a step involves exchanging theas 3 

numerator of the numerals for the rational numbera rather than 
using the rational number as a number on which operations can 
be perfomed without regard to the particular numeral used to 
express it .

6-5. Using -the Number Line 

Here the purpose of the introduction of the number line is 
partly for review and partly to discuss some of the previous parts 
of thls chapter from a somewhat geometrical point of view. It was 
felt that the use of the figure should contribute to the under-
standing of some of the relationships involved. Most of the 
concepts dealt with here are already somewhat familiar to the 
pupils and the stress which the teacher lays on this section 
should depend partly on how familiar pupils are with these ideas. 
The chief new idea In this aection concerns two methods of 
detemlning whether or not two given fractions represent the same 
number. This also looks forward to the discussion of the ordering 

' of rational numbers in the last section of thls chapter. 

Many teachers will notice the absence of the terms "mixed 
i number1' and "improper fraction". The former was omitted in order 

t 

: to avoid some semantic difficulties since the term ''mixed number" 

2 

really refers to a property of the numeral rather than the number; 

[pages 205-2093 


21 

is not a mlxed numba~in the usual sense even though

' T 

.s. !The adjective "mixed" refera merely to the way the numeral 

Is written. The term *Improper fraction" does not have this 

difffculty since it can be described as a rational fraction whose 
numerator la greater than its denominator. But there still did 
not seem to be any point in Introducing it In this aection. It 

is referred to In the laat section of the chapter but not 

especially emphasized. 

Example 4 comes very close to another method of determining 
whether or not two fractions represent the aame number. Here, to 
cb

compare and we write = ad and % ;lb. 
This shows immediately that 6 and represent the same 
number If and onLy If ad = cb: This wa8 not mentioned in the 
students' material because it waa felt that unless the student 
discovered thin for himself, the test would be a purely mechanical 
one. This also applies in the section on ordering.

same divisions could be labelled as fifths and then the 
line would be four unita long. It is important that the

is merely the idea that if we move to the right to add, 
we move in the opposite direction to subtract. The 
teacher should not belabor this point.

by changing them to fractions with equal numerators and

6-9 and 6-10. Ratio and Decimals 
These two sections should be considered as an Introduction 

to two important uses of rational numbers, Both of these the 
students have met before. Here they are shown that a ratio 1s 

another way of thinking of a ratlonal number and that ? decimal 

is a way of wrlting a fraction having a power or 10 In its 
denominator. Decimals and fractions are not separate topics but 
should be treated together. (1n fact, the old term was "decimal 
fractions" .) 

The purpose of the applications IBto give the student a 
little idea of why these notions are useful. This is as far as 
this chapter ia intended to go. Any mastery over either ratio 

[pages 230-2323 


or decimals will come later. If the teacher feels, for Instance, 
that any problem having to do with rates would be too difficult 
for his class. he mav well omit this touic here. 

It is in Chapter 9 that ratio and decimals are taken up 

more thoroughly after the Ideas of this chapter have been given 
an opportunf ty to "set" for awhile. They are also treated In the 
eighth grade in various appropriate places. These topics are much 
too important to be relegated to a single chapter and then 
forgotten. The full appreciation of their relationship with each 
other and later with percent will come in good time if the teacher 
continually works toward this end. At this stage many applica-
tlons would only obscure the fundamental mathematical relation-
ships. As the pupil acquires more experience in hie science 
courses in school and his informal education outside the class-
room, he builds a body of knowledge from which more applications 
can be drawn. 

On the other hand, it Is appropriate to introduce these 
topics here as preparation for what comes later and from the same 
point of view. 

Ratio and decimals will be treated much more extensively in 
Chaptep 9. It is not expected that students will acquire much 
akill with these topics in this brief introduction. It would be 
quite satisfactory not to include these topics in the chapter 
test. Rate as one of the applications of ratio is included to 
emphasize that ratio Is a number and is not associated with a 
wit of measure. As ratio is used in a problem situation, it 
may be necessary to interpret an answer obtained In terms of a 
unit such as miles pep hour or cents per article. The latter, 
for example, would arise in a problem about the coat of 15 pencils 
if six pencils sold for a quarter. One can think of the ratio 

2

of the number of cents to the number of pencils which is $. 

Rate, as an application, was chosen for this section, also 
because the formula, d = rt, ia mathematically exactly the 

same sentence as bx = a, which 1s a basic consideration of the 
chapter. Similarly, cn = t, a formula for the cost of n 

[pages 231-2321 


articles which sell for c cents per article, illustrates a 
use of the sentence bx = a.

6-11. Ordering 

The chief object of this section is to give a means of 
comparing two fractions. The method of finding the decimal 
equivalents of the two fractions is probably a little longer to 
write out than the other method but it also may be easier to 
understand. The pupils should understand both and then be 
allowed to choose that which they prefer. 

It is not thought necessary to give detailed explanation of 
why it is true that when two fractions have equal denominators, 
that with the greater numerator represents the greater number. 
If some students have trouble with this it might be explained, 
for example, that 

because 

Probably the simplest method of comparing fractions Is not 
mentioned. If in Section 5 of this chapter the pupils found that 
= If and only if ad -bc, then it should not be hard 
for them to deduce and use 

) if and only if ad >bc. 
This is probably the simplest test of all, but it is not mentioned 
because if not understood It often becomes purely mechanical.

with the smaller denominator represents the larger 
number. A satisfactory reason from the pupilfs point of 
view at this stage should be that the denominator denotes 
the number of equal parts Into which the numerator is 
divided; if the number of parts la srn~ller,each part 
must be larger. St Is too early to discuss manipulations 
with inequalities.

CHAPTER 7 

MEAS-

Introduction 
The idea of meaaurement is of f'undamental importance In 

! 
modem life, Thia la trme in the day by day activitfee of 
ordinary citlzena and equally true in the activities associated 
with most vocations. Newspapers and other klnda of reading 
matter are full of refemncea to measurement8 of one kind or 
another. Consequently, there is a great deal of information 
about the topic whlch could conceivably be taught in the seventh 
grade, and which some, If not all, aeventh grade pupils would 
find both uaeful and interesting. The ability to understand 
what other people are doing depend8 to a conalderable extent on 
c era tan ding the kinds of things they measure and the techniques 
of meaaurement whlch are wed. This in turn depend8 upon an 
understanding of the nature of the thing measured. Adequate 
treatment of marry techniques of measurement la therefore more 
Buttable content for couraee in other fields, such as science, 
than in mathematlcer . 
The fundamental notion of meaawment, however, la common to 
measurement in all fields, and the development of basic concepts 
is therefore an impoptant topic in the mathematfca curriculum, 
The measurement of one-, two-, and three-dimensional figures is 
alao aasential both for development of certain geometric concepts 
and for applying these concepts. Furthermore, many thing0 which 
are not geometric in chamter ape measured by relating their 
properties to linear or circular ecales. In thia chapter, there-
fore, attention la focused chiefly upon development of basic 
concepts whlch underlie measurements of all klnda, and upon 
measurements of line negpnta, aurfacea, solida, and anglea. 
While pupils entering the neventh grade have had a substantial 

amount of experience with meaaurement, some of them may have no 
clear underatanding of the baaic concepts and assumptions which 
underlie the procesa. Among the concegta developed in this 
chapter are the followlng: 


1. The size of a collection of discrete objects is found by 
counting and described by numbers; the size of a continuous 
quantity is found by measuring and described by a measurement 
which contains both a number and a unit of measurement. 
2, The process of counting separate objects yields a whole 
number which represents exactly the aize of the collection; the 
process of measuring yields a number of units which is never 
exact, but is an approximate representation of the size of the 

quantity measured. 

3. Since all measurements are approximate; a measurement 
should be reported so as to Indicate its precision, or its 
peatest pdsaible error. The precision is shown by naming the 
smallest unit or subdivision used. This implies the size of the 
greatest possible error, or the Interval within which the true 
measurement liea. Pupils should be encouraged to report measure-
ments which they have made in a way consistent with this idea, but 
cannot be expected at this stage to understand fully its impli-
cations for computed measurements. 
4, As suggested above, development of a method for measur-
ing anything rests upon understanding the aspect of it whlch is to 
be measured. This is true of the measurement of geometric con-
tinuous quantities to which a large part of this chapter refers, 
Therefore, four asaumptlona regarding the nature of geometric 
continuous quantltlea are atated. 

5. A unit of measurement for geometric quantities must be of 
the same kind as the thing to be measured--a unit line sewent to 
measure a line segment, a unft surface to measure a surface. 
6. The slze of a unit of measurement is arbitrary. 
7. The measure of a geometric quantity is obtained by sub-
dividing it into parts the slze of the unit, and counting the 
number of unft parts. 
8. Standard unita of measurement are necessary in highly 
organized societies, and are established by social agreement. 
9. It is convenient to have related units for length, 
surface, and volume, such as the inch, square inch, and cubic 
inch. 

10. The area of a region enclosed by a simple cloaed curve, 
such as the rectangle, may be found by computation from lengths 
rather than direct measurement of surface; the same ia true for 
the volume of a rectangular solid. 
11. Just as there are many namea for the same number, there 
are many name~lfor the same measurement. 
12. Many quantities of different nature from those stressed 
in this chapter can be measured when suitable units are used. 
7-1. Counting -and Measurin~ 

Section One develops the difference between discrete objects 
and continuous quantities. Four properties of geometric figurea 
are developed at this time: 

1. The motion p~opertystates that figurea can be moved 
without changing aize or shape. 
2. The comparison property atates that the aizes of two 
geometric quantitiea can be compared provided these 
quantitiea have the same nature. 
3. The matching property states that two geometric quantl-
ties have the same aize if every part of one can be 
matched to a part of the second so that no part of 
either figure is omitted. 
4. Fimally, it ia stated that a geometric figure may be 
subdivided. 
These four properties are the basis of measurement, The 
teacher should be alert in later sections to point out that the 
measuring process utilizes these properties. Measuring ia done 
in thls section but many students will not recognize it as such 
since shdapd unita are not used. 

Problem 1 and 2 develop the concept of continuous quantities 
in contrast to discrete objects. Problems 3 to 5 develop the 
concept of measuring as a comparison to a unit having the same 
nature as the object measured. Problems 6 and 7 direct attention 
to the possibility that different sized closed regions may be 
bounded by closed curves of the same length, and that a closed 

[pages 243-2451 


region of a given size mag be encloeed by curves of different 
lengths.

-2. Subclivieion an8 Measurement 

Measuring geometric continuous quantities is accompllahed by 
the process of subdividing the quantities into unit parta. We 
think of geometric figures aa keeping both size and shape when 
they are moved. This is Important for comparison of two geometric 
quantities, and also for subdividing a quantity into parts. 

There is the hidden aaaumption in the Comparieron Property 
Wt, For two geomet~icguantitiea a and b, a = b, a ia 
greater than b, or a is leas than b, and that exactly one 
of these relatlana ie true. By using the Motion Property it la 
possible to determine which of these relations is true for any 
two quantities of the same kind. 

The Matching Pmperty la basic to the notion that differently 
shaped polygons, or other simple cloaed curves, may have equal 
perimeter8 or Porn closed regions having the same area. It lea& 
to the Subdivision Property which states the aseuraption that a 

[pages 248-2491 


quantity may be subdivided wlmout producing a change in the size 

of the whole. All of these properties are wed in the process of 
measuring. 

Note that we do -not define such concepta a8 length, area, 
volume, etc . We attempt to lead the students toward an intuitive 
gmp of these concepts, 

The paragraphs on Subdividing Continuou8 Quantities illwtrate 
with line segments the essentfal notion that a unit aegnent "n" 
may be laid off repeatedly on a given segment to locate a point 
such that the segment remaining Is lese than one unit, The 
concepts developed in Sections 1 and 2 provide the basia for the 
definition of the tern 'measure" and "unlt of measurement. Note 
that, according to the definition, the measure is a nmber, while 
the lewth ia defined aa a phrase which includes both the measure 
and the unlt. 

Actually we take a measurement of a length. The more precfse 
our measurement is the cloaer we come to the length. However, 
the measurement is not the exact length since we cannot possibly 
hope to achieve absolute precision. Hence, when we aay the length 
is 4x1 we mean the meaeurement is 4n. The length is b 4n. 
Here wa have a clear-cut example of the distinction between the 
abstract mathematical notion of length and the fitting of this 
notion to the physical world through measurement . Thia Is why we

7-4. Standard Unite 

The pupils kave had many exercises to demonatrate the meaning 
of meaaumment and the arbitrary nature of the unit. This sectlon 
should establlah the social need for unite that are the same for 
the entire group. Masa production and the convenience of inter-
changeable parts provide a wealth of material for pointing out 
this need. The historical material ehould be of interest and show 
Eiocietyl s increasing need for atandalld units. 

Archimedee used density in detemlnlng the purity of gold. 
By experiment, he found that the same weights of silver and of 
gold displaced different volumes of water. By immersing gold that 
had the same weight as the crown and comparing the water displace-
ment with that displaced by the crown, Archimedes showed that the 
crown was not all gold. 

The metric system la briefly Introduced in this chapter only 
beoause of the chapter's length; it wlll be discussed more fully 
in Chaptep 3 of Volume 11. It should be stressed that our linear 
units are defined, by law, in terms of the metric units. The 
metric system la legal In the U.S. If class time permita, a dis-

This standard for the meter ie difficult to visualize, but has the 
advantage that It can be reproduced in any good scientific labom-
tory and is more precise than the platinum and iridium bar in 
France that is the pPenent standard for the meter, Thla definition 
has been adopted by the Advisory Connnittee on the Definition of the 
Meter. Curmnt Science for the week of September 29 -October 3, 
1958 ha8 an article on this at the student's level. 

The approximate nature of measurement has been pointed out 
throughout the chapter. Continuing emphasia on the fact that 
measurements are not exact ahould be made, although thia topic will 
be treated more formally in Section 5, Comparing measummenta oP

detemined by Instruments marked with varying degrees of precision 
help develop the concept of the approximate nature of measurement.

7-5. Precision of Measurement --

-and the Greateat Possible Error 
This section Is the first attempt in this book to formalize 
the approximate nature of measurement. Precision of measurement 
is Introduced through work with the ruler. Precision, a8 such, 
is -not defined. We do epeak of one measurement as being more 
preclee than another. At firat, incremlng precision of measure-
ment is Indicated by increasing denominatom (of the fractions 
repmsenting the aubdiviaion being wed). This was done so that 
the two "things" under discussion would both be "moving" in the 
same direction, 1.e. increasing. Iater the Idea la introduced 
that increasing preciaion of measuremnt Is associated wlth 
decreasing unit aize (this counter motion can cause difficulty 
for the students) . 

Suppoee we are given units A and B with B smaller than A. 
A measumment made wlth unit B is more preci~ethan one made 
with A because the measurement obtained with unit B 1s closer 
to the true measurement than that obtained with unit A. 

If an attempt la made to define precision as a noun we get 
into a situation where Increasing precieion is aesoclated with 
decrea~ingaccuracy. This should be avolded as it contradicts 
normel associations of these words. 


Two notations are wed for indicating preclalon of measure-
ment. 

Indicated by the form of the numeral and the name of the 

unit, e .g. in. indicates measurement to the nearest 
1 1

8 in. This fraction must -not be simplified to %. This 

idea can be used later with decimals, e.g. 4.13 in. in-
1

dicates measurement to the nearest in, 

Indicated by using the greatest possible error and the 
name of the unlt. This idea is used later in the dis-
cussion of precision of area measurement. The first 
notation cannot be used for area; thia is pointed out in 
Section 7.

7-6. Measurement of Arwlea 

In Chapter 4 the pupils have been introduced to the concept 
of angle as the set of points on two rays with a common endpoint, 
and have learned to describe the position of a point as being on 
the angle, in the interior of the angle, or in the exterior of the 
angle. The measurement of angle follows essentially the same Ideas 
as measurement of a line ae-nt; that is, (1) the unit for measur-
ing an angle must be itself an angle; (2) the interior of the wle 
la aubdivided by drawing raya which form angles like the wit 
angle; (3) the measure of the angle la the number of unit angles 
into which It Is subdivided. After these ideaa are developed in 
Exercises 7-6a, the standard unit, the degree, and the acale for 
measuring angles in degreerr, are introduced. The unft angle la 
determined by a set of 181 rays drawn from the same point. These 
ray8 determine 180 congruent anglea which, together with their 
interiors make a half-plane and the line which determines the half-
plane. The rays are numbered in order from 0 to 180, forming a 
scale. ~igure7-6a shows such a scale. me of the 180 congruent 
angles is selected aa the standard unft angle. Its rneasmernent 
is called a degree. 

The most common type of protractor shows the scale only from 
0 to 180, and uaually contains two such scales, one with 0 at the 
right end and the other with 0 at the left end of the semicircular 
scale. Each pupil should have a protractor and should become pro-
ficient in using It, both to measure a given angle and to draw an 
angle of a specified number of degrees, 

The angle la defined as having a measure greater than 0 de-
grees and leas than 180 degrees. 

Angles are classified as acute, right, OP obtuse, according 
to their measures. The pupils should practice estimating the 
number of degrees in an angle by comparing it with a right angle. 

Perpendicular rays are defined ae raya which form a right 
angle and the term "perpendicular" fa also applied to lines, seg-
ments, and to combinations of these.

AREAS VOLm, WEIGHT AND TIM3 

8-1. Rectangle 

The two primary aims of this section are to develop the 
pupilst apace perception, especially aa it relates to perimeters 
and areas, and to develop methods of finding these quantities for 
a rectangle by computation when the length and width are known. 
In development of space perception and a geometric feeling for 
size, it is Important that models be constantly in sight. Perhaps 
drawings of the actual eizee of the Inch square, foot aquare, and 
yard square could be kept on the blackboard aa soon as area has 
been Introduced. Poaaibly models could be placed on the bulletin 
board. Also emphasis on estimating lengths and sreaa will help to 
develop a Feeling for size. As often as possible have estimates 
made of lengths and areas and then have them actually measured 

(or computed) to check the accuracy of the estimate. This 
emphaaie will necessarily come largely from the teacher, as such 
questions can only be auggeated occaslonally in the text. It is 

interesting that most people are quite surprised to see the 
actual size of a square yard. 

Two points of terminology should be clarified. 

1. By its definition a rectangle is a collection of 
segnents. Such a set of points does not properly have 
an area (or poasibly it should be said to have area 
zero). The area with which we are concerned is 
the area of the closed rectangular region; that is, the 
union of the aet of points --set
on the rectangle and the 
of pointe --In order to emphasize thla,

In its Interior. 
it is the plan in the text to state that we mean the 
area of the closed rectangular region when we say the 
area of the rectangle. Whlle the student may lapse into 
the mathematical slang of speaking of the area of a 
rectangle, from time-to-time remind him of the fact that 
he 18 using mathematical slang. 


The concept of area of a closed regfon is close to the 
intuitive concept which young students have. Moreover, with 
this idea length, area, and volume can be treated similarly in 
terms of unions: 

1. A line segment 2 inches long is the union of two unit 
line segments each 1 inch in length. 
2. A closed rectangular region of length 2 in. and width 
1 in. is the union of two unit rectangular closed regions 
I in. by 1 in. 
3. A rectangular solid 2 in. by 1 in. by 1 In. is the union 
of two unit cubical solids. 
This closed region viewpoint Is different from that used in 
the 1959 edition. In that editlon area was based on the concept 
of region as defined in Chapter 4; you thought, for example, in 
terms of "the area of the interior of a rectangle. " In terms of 
the "interior concept," the p~ecedingstatements 1, 2, and 3 do 
not hold. Many people believe that the "closed region concept" 
will be easier to teach because it Is closer to the student's 
It experience. " 

No definitions of length, area, or volume appear in this 
chapter. The viewpoint la quite intuitive. When precfse 
definitions of these words are given it can be shown that area of 
the interior of a simple closed cupve has meaning. Moreover, this 
latter area is equal to the area of the corresponding closed 
region. In a similar fashion we could talk about the set of 
points on a line sement -not including the endpoints as the 
IIinterior" of the line segment. This set of points would have a 
length equal to the length of the line seggnent. Similar comments 
can be made for volume. 

Mathematically speaking, neither of these viewpoints is 
preferable to the other. As stated, the student has in mind the 
concept of a line segment. The closed region concept ties into 
this concept of length. 


Both terminologies appear In problems. It Is natural to 
think of the volume of a room as meaning the volume of the 
interior of the rectangular prism. 

2. It has been emphasized in previous sections that the 
measure of a quantity is the number of units it contains. 
However, in describing the result of a measurement it is 
meaningless to give the number without specifying the 
unit. Thus when we speak of a length, or an area, or 
a volume we shall mean the number together with the unit, 
as a length of 5 ft. or an area of 5 square inches. On 
the othe~hand we should keep clearly in mind that 
wherever literal symbols are introduced, they stand 
only for numbers. We add and multiply numbers, not 
units. Thus if we consider a rectangle whose length is 
5-in. and whose width Is 3 in., and If we wish to use 
the notation of the number sentences p = 2(&+ w) and 
A =Lw, we write l=5, w = 3, p = 2(5 + 3) = 16, 
A = 5.3 = 15 so we conclude that the perimeter ---
is 16 in. 
and ---the area is 15 89. &. Note that we do not write 
&= 5 in. or A = 15 sq. in. Here again, the student 
may in the future, without permanent ham to his 
character, write such mathematical slang as A = 15 sq. 
in., but at this point it has seemed better to 
distinguish clearly between a length, which requires 
specifying a unit, and the number of units A in this 
length, 

The questfon about the pelation of squares to rectangles in 
the first paragraph of this section hae two purposes. The 
discuseion should first serve to clarify any doubt as to exactly 
what a square is. Then, bringing out that such a figure is a 
special case of a rectangle gives a good example of one set 
contained In another. The question in the second paragraph Is 
intended $0 bring out that a sewent is measured by a number line 
of segments and our model of this is a ruler. However, a closed 


rectangular region not being a segment, cannot be measured by 
segments, but must be measured by a closed rectangular region--
something of the same kind. Some pupils may argue that you -could 
measure the closed rectangular region with a ruler by seeing how 
many times the ruler could be fitted on It. In a sense this is 
true, but point out that, if you do that, you ape no longer 
considering the ruler as a model of a number line and using just 
Its numbered edge. You would actually be using it as a closed 
rectangular region. 

Exercisee 8-la 

Problems 1-5 are part of the developmental work and should 
definitely be used, although some or all of them might well be 
done In class. The other problems in the set ar@ practice 
exercises on understanding perimeter, computation, and change of 
units. Problem 10 should be included in the assigned work as 
these ideas often seem troublesome. 

Areas of Rectangles 

The question in the firat paragraph about an Instrument to 
uae directly In measuring areas should provoke useful discussion. 
Someone may well pofnt out that you could have a network of closed 
square regions (or whatever figure you use a8 unit of area) marked 
on transparent plastic and just place this on the rectangular 
closed region being measured. This is quite true, and is both an 
interesting and valuable idea. However, it should be pointed out 
that In using this you would actually have to count up the squares 
(and parts of squares). You cannot number the squares ahead of 
time so that you can just look at the number attached to a "last" 
square and say that is (approximately) the desired area. The 
difficulty fa that while all sements have the same shape in the 
sense of being fitted by a number line (ruler), areas may occur in 
all sorts of shapes so that no prearranged pattern can be designed 


to fit all the ahapes to be measured in such a way as to read off 
areas at sight. Your pupils may be interested to know that there 
are instruments which can be run around the boundaries of a simple 
closed curve and give at once an approximate value for the area of 
the closed region, One such instrument is the planimeter, but 
its theory is far beyond the level of our work here. 

In developing the method for computing areas of rectangles 
from the length and width it is noted that different ways of 
counting the unlt areas Illustrate the commutative property of 
mu1tlplication . 

It is hoped that class discussion will bring out the 
advantage of having a unit of area which is a closed square region, 
one unit .oflength on a side. In the case of the illustration of 
the rectangle 6 unlts by 3 units, notice the effect of using, as 
unit of area, a closed square reglon Is1 units on a side. There is 
no trouble about covering the closed rectangular region with these 
unfts as shown below. 

3 UNITS 

6 UNITS 

However, the number of squares in each row is no longer the number 

of linear unlts in the length 6 and the number of rowa is no 
longer the number of linear units in the width (3). Thus we 
would lose the relationship of finding the nwnber of aquare units 
of area by multlplyfng the numbers of linear units in the length 
and width. It certainly would be possible to devise methods of 
computing the number of these new square units of area, but it 
would also be more complicated.

Problems 1-3 are developmental, leading to the method for 
computing area of a rectangle from the numbers of linear units 
In the length and width. 

Exercises 8-lb 
In connection with Problem 3 notice the comments in the 
first paragraph of the commentary in the section about emphasizing 
space perception. Estimating areas of doors, windows, black-
boards, etc. in the various units of area and then measuring to 
check estimates is very valuable experience. Following ProbJem 
3, which furnishes the information necessary, many of the problems 
call for conversion between various unlta of area. The process 
is the same as for linear units, but it may be well to illustrate 
it for the class. For example, since 1 sq. ft. -144 sq. in., 
then 1 sq. in. = 1 sq. ft. Thua to change 360 sq. in. to 
square feet we write 360 ~q.in. = 360 1

1 sq. in -360 . 
1 

sq. ft. = sq. ft. = 22 sq. ft. 

Problems 4, 5 are deai~edto clsrify the common confusion 
between the 3-inch square and the area of 3 square inches, and to 
emphasize the different possible shapes an area of 1 square inch 
may take. Problems 11-15 are a connected group and are extremely 
important. They emphasize the effect of doubling the dimensions 
of a rectangle either separately or simultaneously. Problems 
11-14 approach the problem geometrically and it should be empha-
sized that such doubling amounts to laying identical rectangles 
end to end or side by side, The dotted lines in the figures in 
the answer key Indicate the relationships we hope the pupil will 
see. Problem 15 shows how these geometric facts are related to 
properties of rational numbers that have already been studied.

Problems 1-5 are drill problems in finding areas and 
perimeters and in converting units, with emphasis that such 
answers must generally be considered approximate. This section 
could provide further opportunity for estimating and verification. 
Problem 7 illustrates finding areas as a difference of known 
areas.

Class Exercises 8-lb 
Problems 1-3 are a unit which develop the idea of precision 
and greatest possible error in a computed measurement. They are 
important if the class is capable, though not easy. The length 
and width of a rectangle are given wlth a precision of Bl inch 

(i.e. measurements to the nearest quarter inch). The pupil is 
asked to compute the area from these figures. Thls proves to be 
8q. in. He then draws the largest and smallest rectangles 
which are represented by the given measurements with this 
precision and computes their areas. The largest posslbie 
difference between the true area and the computed area above 
proves to be 8sq. in. ao the result is written in the form 

Area is (e-+ 8)sq. in. 

The peatest possible error is sq. in. and the precision, 

which is the total range about wlthln which the true answer 

must OCCUT, is 9sq. In. (i.e . twice the greatest possible 

error). The Important thing to emphasfze is the slze of the 
possible error in the calculated answer. The average pupil who 

15

compute^ an area as above and gets %sq. In. is inclined to 
assume this is correct to the nearest sixteenth of a square inch, 
but the calculation shows that the possible error Is much greater 

than this. 

[pages 310-3151 


The intention in these problems is to promote a healthy 
skepticism about the precision of calculated answers, 1.e. to 
have the students realize that working with approximate figures 
not only givea approximate results but that the errors may be 
greatly expanded and that the results are generally not as good 
as they look. As a matter of fact they are practically never 
as good as the form of the answer suggests.

8-2. Rectangular Prism 

The remarks under Sectlon 8-1 about development of space 
perception should be repeated here emphatically. The concept 
of volume and the sizes of different units of voluine need much 
reinforcing, Models of cubic inches will be constructed but 
models of cubic feet and cubic garda are necessary also. Practice 
in estimating volumes should be very helpful. A framework for 
a model of a cubic yard can be formed from 12 yardsticks. 
Most adults are astounded at the sZte of a cubic yard when they 
see one. One teacher had students bring in cardboard cartons 
that could be cut to the size of a cubic foot and assembled a 
model cubic yard from 27 of these boxes. Grocery captons which 
are partitioned by cardboard dividers may be helpful in visual-
izing the subdivision of a volume into units. 

Just as a rectangle Is composed of the polnts on its 
segments, so a rectangular prism is made up of the points on 
its faces, 1.e. on its supface. Thus if a brick is suggested 
as an example of this figure, point out that the prism consists 
only of the surface of the brick. A rectangulap -solid consists 
of the points on the surface of a rectangular prism together 
with thoae In Its interior. F3r this reason though we do speak 
of the volume of a rectangular prism, we actually mean the 
volume of the rectangular solid. As in the last aectlon, the 
stating of a measurement requires both the number and the unit 
used, but any letter in a number sentence stands only for a 
number,

, -, . , , 

The rectangular prism with its 6 faces, 12 edgea, and 
8 vertices will need to be shown to the class with models and 
illustrations. The approach is frankly intuitive. However, 
once it has been agreed that the faces are rectangles, this can 
be used to deduce the fact that opposite faces have the same 
measurements. For example In the following figure 

FF and AB have the same length because they are opposite 
sides of rectangle ABFE . 
and Cb have the same length because they are opposite 
sidee of rectangle ABCD. 
CI) and have the same length because they are opposite 
aides of rectangle DCGH. 

Thus the four segment8 'AB, , m,a all have the same 
length. Similarly "AE, , and have the same length 
and , m, m, and 'BC have the same length. This shows 
that any two opposite faces have the erne measurements. 

Exercises -8-2a 

These problems will probably be difficult, not because of 
the arithmetic, which is easy, but because of the spacial visual-
izing required. It 18 suggested that in doing these problems 
each pupil keep a box or other model in front of him to help 

[pagee 318-3191 


visualize the problems that are presented. Except for the 
difficulty of visualizing, the problems are applications of 
work on rectangles in the last section. There is further drill 
on change of units. Problems 3 and 6 give further practice on 
finding areas by subtraction. Problem 9 introduces the term 
cube. 

In discussing the choice of a unit of volume bring out that 
its edges are units of length and its faces units of area, while 
its Interior is the unit of volume.

A pattern for a 1 inch cube is given here. These cubes 
should be made in advance so that they are ready for use in the

It is extremely important that the pupil see and be able to 
visualize that the effect of doubling the length of a rectangular 
solid amounts to laying two such solids end to end, both just 
like the original one. Similarly, that doubling two of the 
measurements amounts to putting four such sollds together and 
that doubling all three measurements

is equivalent to putting eight sueh cubical solids together. 
It is this visual perception, not a counting up of the cubical 
solids used, that is really significant. Also the models fonned 
here show nicely the layers of sollda which are used in the next 
developmept . 

In the question asked just before Exerclaea 8-2b, observe 
that if the base contains a half-unit square, we need only slice 
a unlt cube in two vertically and stand thie half unit cube on 
the half unit square. Similarly, for a quarter unit square and 
so on. Thus the total number of cubical solids in the bottom 
layer of volume is always the same as the number of square mitt3 
In the base. 


Exercises 8-2b 

These problems have all been designed to emphasize the 
relation symbolized by the number sentence V = Eh. They have 
been deliberately chosen in such a way that the actual shape 
of the base 1s not knom in any of them. This Is to lay the 
foundation for the discussion later of volumes of prisms and 
cylinders, as well as the specific case of the rectangular prism 
which is discussed next. 

In the question asked just before Exercises 8-2c the 
propertlea involved are the commutative and associative properties 
of mu1tiplication . 

Problems 3 and 4 are an integral part of the development. 
Problem 5 lays the basta for changes of cubic units which are 
introduced frequently thereafter. Problem 7 ia to clapify

Problem 8 emphasizes two different possible shapes of a volume 
of 1 cubic inch. Patterns for the modela, If this is necessary, 
are found on Pages 236-37. Problem g Is an algebraic approach to 
the geometric ideas developed In Clasa Exercises 8-2. Problem 
10 affords opportunity for more estimating and measuring. 
Problems 18-20 develop the ideas of meateat posaible -error 
and precision for computed volumes. They are comparable to 
Problems 1-3 of Exercises 8-lb and the same comments apply. 
With respect to error in computed volume, it is possible to 
give a graphic illustration of the substantial effect on volume 
of a fairly small error in measurements of length, width, and 
height as followa: Take a rectangular block of cheese (a two-
pound package possibly, though a smaller one would do) and 

1

imagine an error of Inch. With a cheese cutter slice off 8 

inch thick slices from three faces which meet at a vertex. The 
total volume of these sllces is the change in volume due to an 
error of only 6inch in each of the three measurements . This 

[pagee 323-3261 


is quite an lmpresaive amount. A rectangular block of clay 
could perhaps be used for the erne purpose. This demonstration 
could be done without attempting to do Problems 18-20 above. 
As noted earlier, a skepticism with respect to the preclslon 
of such computed answers is a healthy thing. 

In the discussion of dimension some of your better pupils 
may raise the question of describing the location of the sugar 
in other ways than by motions parallel to the edges of a room. 
For example In the second figure in the section under Dimension 
it may be suggested that the fly at A might simply point out 
the direction of S and tell his friend to crawl a certaln 
distance in that direction. This is an excellent Idea. However, 
note that these directions still call for two numbers, one 
describing the angle telling the direction in which the fly is to 
crawl, and the other giving the distance he must crawl. A 
precise deflnltion of dimension involves very substantial 
difficulties beyond the scope of thls course, but you will find 
that any "reaeonable" way of describing location of points in 
the different sets will use the same number of numbers in the 
description, so that concept of dimenalon has meaning, 

In the determination of volume for an irregular stone you 
may get various interesting suggestions to consider. One method 
is the immersion method, which would work as follows: Take a 
rectangular prism partially filled with water (or sand or salt 
or some other convenient substance). By measuring the length and 
width of the container and the depth of the water, the volume of 
water can be found. Now irnmerae the stone and determine the 
new volume. The difference of the volumes is the volume of the 
stone. In practice It is often a problem to flnd a suitable 
rectangular container. Sometimes toothbrush containers come in 
thls shape and would do for small stones. Rectangular aquariums 
are good If you can find one and want to measure a good sized 
stone. If salt or sand is used as material, plenty of cardboard 
boxes are available .

8-3. Other Measures 

Students should not be left with the impression that length 
is the only item that is measured. This chapter has dealt largely 
with length, area and volume. Some time waa spent on angle 
measure and students are familiar with time, temperature, and 
weight as measured quantities. The limitation of time forces a 
choice between a casual and inadequate treatment of many measures 
and a more thorough treatment of a few. A real understanding 
of measurement concepts should make any future work with other 
measures aimpler. To overcome the impresalon that only lengths, 
areaa and volumes are measured, a short section on time and weight 
1s included. 

The distinction made in the student text between computing 
with numbers and computing with measurements should be emphasized 
though not belabored. Note that we actually give new meanings to 
"equals," "add," etc. This type of procedure ie quite common 
further along In mathematics. 

Seventh grade students have had some experience adding and 
subtracting measured quantities. The explanation given here 
should be treated as review. Subtraction provides an excellent 
opportunity to strengthen the student's understanding of place 
value and the base of a number system. This can be b~oughtout 


by showing that in subtracting measures, a procedure similar to 
subtracting numbers is used. In base ten, when a digit in the 
minuend is too small for the step in subtraction a one in the next 
larger place is exchanged for ten of the smaller. Similarly, when 
necessary in subtracting measures, one large unit ia exchanged 
for its equivalent in smaller units. The complete lack of system 
In the relationships between various units of measure offers an 
opportunity to review number bases by showing what bases would be 
convenient to use for a specific set of two related units. This 
should appeal to the brighter student. 

Multiplication and division of measured quantltles by a 
number will be new for most 7th grade students, but should cause 
little difficulty. Some of the better students will benefit from 
dlviding composite quantitfes without changing to the smallest 
unit. An interpretation of the meaning of the remainder should 
be required. Practice in simple conversions is an essential part 
of this process, since remainders must be changed to the next 
smaller unit in order to complete the problem. 

Some of these conversions provide considerable practice in 
fundamental arithmetic operations; units of area and volume 
require large nmbers . 

You will notice that without additional comment we have 
referred to the gram as the unit of mass, not weight, in the 
metric system. It was thought best not to Involve the pupils 
in a full-scale discussion of this point here. An adequate 
treatment of the ideas belongs in a high school physics course. 
It is likely, however, that some of your pupils will ask questions 
about this terminology, and you will want to know how to answer 
them correctly, if not in complete detail. The following dls-
cussion should be adequate for this purpose. Should you wish more 
information on the subject, you might refer to Physics, Volume I, 
prepared by the Physical Science Study Committee of Educational 
Services, Inc. (This is the first volume of the so-called M.I.T. 
course for high school physics students .) 

[pages 333-334 1 


What is the weight of an object? It is a measurement of the 
force or "pull" of gravity on that object . An ordinary bathroom 
scale measures this pull by the amount it stretches, or twists, a 
spring. We think of weight as measuring the "quantity of matter" 
in an object, in some sense. A box of lead weighs more than the 
same box filled with feathers because the lead has a greater 
"quantity of matter" packed into the given volume than do 
feathers. There 1s another way to measure the "quantity of 

' matter" of an object. This is to compare the object with some 
standad, or unit, bodies on a balance. If we have a supply 
of identical objects called "gramattwe can determine the number 
of these "grams" it takes to balance the box of lead. This number 
of grams we call the mass of this much lead. 

These two different ways of measuring "quantity of mattertt 
can be used interchangeably for moat purposes in any one fixed 
location, but they ape not, strictly speaking, measurements of 
the same thing. Weight depends on the nearness to the center of 
the earth, The pull of the earth--gravity--on the box of lead 
would be much smaller in a space ship as far from the earth as 
Is, say, the moon. The weight of the lead would be much smaller 
there. However, the lead would balance the same number of "gramstt 
on the space ship which it balanced on the earth (the "grams" 
would themselves weigh correspondingly less) so Its mass would 
be unchanged. To summarize: 

Weight is the pull of the earth. It changes as 
the distance between the object and the center of 
the earth changes. 

Mass is a comparison of the object with a set of 
unit bodies. It does not depend on the position 
in space where it is measuped. 

[pages 333-334 I 


We humans are normally restricted to a very narrow range of 
altitude above sea level, and with that restriction, we can think 
of weight and mass as having a definite fixed relationship. (1t 
is tempting to predict that as we enter the space age and are 
released fram these restrictions, weight and mass and the dis-
tinctions between them will become subjects for household 
discussion.) In the English System weight Is measured in pounds, 
mass in slugs. An object which has a mass of 1 slug has a 
weight of approximately 32.2 pounds et sea level. The weight 
In pounds of any object is approximately 32.2 times its mass in 
slugs. The more common unit in this aystem, of courae, is the 
pound. In the metric system, when mass is measured in grams, 
weight is measured in dynes. An object whose mass is one gram 
has a weight of approximately 980 dynea at sea level. The 
welght of thls same object in the Engliah System would be 
approximately 0.0022 pounds. As you probably know, the more 
familiar unit In the metric system Is the unit of mas, the gram. 

In the text we have introduced only the more familiar unita, 
pound and gram. This has made It necessapy to uae both words, 
mass and weight. You must judge for youreelf how much of the 
above discussion of the two ideas you will use in your classroom. 
If the aubject does come up, however, be aupe to make one point: 
both mass and weight can be measured in efther of the systems of 
units, English and metric . If you fail to point thia out to the 
pupil, he may interpret the discussion in the text to mean that 
weight is something measured In the English aystem and maaa 
something measured in the metric system.
