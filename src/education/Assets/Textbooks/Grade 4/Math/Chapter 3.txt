WHOLE NUMBERS 

3-1. Countinp; Numbers. 
Page 67. Understandfngs to be developed in this section: 

(a) Number is an idea. 
(1) Small numbers can be learned without counting, 
some large ones by patterns. (Cards, ~ominoes) 
(2) The number of members of any set can be found by 
matching the members of theset with some standard 
set. This is a clwnsy method If the number of 
members Is large, as the standard sets must them-
selves be large. 
(3) Matching the members of a set with a memorized set 
of sounds representing the countlng numbers is the 
best known way of finding the number of members in 
a set. 

(b) One-to-one correspondence. 
Two sets are in a one-to-one correspondence when 
each member of one set is matched with only one 
member of the other set and vice-versa. 
(c) "~ountingmmbers" are sometimes calf ed "natural numbers1' 
(d) The name that we give to the set of counting numbers 
and zero Is "whole numbers." The counting numbers do 
-not include zero.

3-2. Commutative Properties for Whole Numbers. 
Page '70. The principal objective In the study of the commutative, 
associative, and dlstributive properties is to have the puplls 
understand their statements in mathematical language; to dia-
tingulsh one property from another; and to recognize the property 
or properties, that may be used in such problems as in Exercises 
3 and 4. These are not propertiea that are being proved. The 
pupils have used them for a long the, but they probably have 
not had names for them and have not recognized when they have 
been uslng them. 

The pupils will be helped in understanding the commutative 
property if they have some small objects with which to work. 
Pieces of paper will do but cubical blocks will be better. Cubi-
cal blocks will be more useful in illustrating the associative 
property for multiplication. lhphasize that the commutative 
property 1s a property of (belongs to) the operation of addition 
and Is not dependent upon the numeration system that Is used. 


! 
!
Use Roman numerals and numbers in base five to illustrate. For 
' example in base five add 

This is a good qpportunity to review numbers in numeration systems 
other than that with base ten. 

Students should be taught to add ''up the column" as well as 
IIdom the colwnn." Use three whole numbers in the addition since 
the use of three numbers will not only illustrate commutativity 
but will lead very naturally into associativity.

Then have them push the first two sets together and count the 
total (3 -I-2) + 4. Then after rearranging have them push the 
second two sets together and count the total 3 + (2 -k 4). Use 
sufficient variations of this procedure to lead to the under-
standing that (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) where a, b, c are any 
counting numbers. 

Then ask: Is the product (3 x 4) x 5 equal to the product 
3 x (4 x 5)?

This may be illustrated by arranging a set of 20 blocks in 

a rectangular array, 4 by 5. Then put two more layers of 20 
blocks each on top of these forming a box arrangement. Look at 
it in different ways to see (3 x 4) x 5 and 3 x (4 x 5). 
Different sets of boxes may be made to Illustrate 2 x (3 x 4), 
(2 x 3) x 4 and many others. Again, emphasfs is upon arrival 
at understanding that a . (b . c) = (a . b) . c where a, b, c

3-5. Sets and the Closure Property. 
Page -84. Pnphasis here is placed upon (1) understanding the 
meaning of set and (2)the meaning of a set closed under an opera-
tion. Pupils will give many examples of sets. There is just one 
empty set, The set of marbles which has no marbles in It is the 

same as the set of coins which a pupil has in his pocket if he 

[pagee 83-84 1 


has no coins in his pocket. 

Good examples of sets closed under addition: 

The set of whole numbers. 

The set of counting numbers. 

Then ask if they are closed under multiplication. Lr:fier 
subtraction? Under division? 

Rnphasize that if just one pair of counting numbers can be 
found such that thefr difference (or quotient) is not a counting 
number, then the set of counting numbers Is not closed under sub-
traction (or dlvlsion) . For example, 9-12 is not a counting 
number for there is no counting number which can be added to 12 
to get 9 and 12 is not a counting number slnce there Is no 
counting number which can be multiplied by 9 to get 12.

Page 88. The basic concepts In this section are: 

1. The meaning of inverse. 
2. Addition and multiplication have the closure, 
cormutative, and associative properties, while 
their inverses do not. 
The meaning of inverse may be explained by giving an example, 
"I write on the chalkboard" may be stated as one actually writes 
"inverse" on the board. Then the teacher may say "The inverse 
of writing on the board is erasing the board." The board may be 
actually erased. If the phrase "opposite or inverset'is used it 
may help the pupil underatand the meaning of inverse. It should 
be emphasized that the inverae operation undoes the first 
operation. Some pupils may think that the railure to do an 
operation is the inverse of the operation. For example, to the 
question "What is the inverse of singing?" the pupil may say 
"~otsinging." "~otsinging" is the negation of "singing" and 
Is not the inverse of "singing." In this connection it is 
Important to point out that some operations have no inverse. 

Some discussion of a . x = b may be helpful to many 
students. The following questions may be suggestive, 

1. What operation Is indicated by a 
x? 

2. What operation will undo multiplication? 

3. What is the inverse of multiplication? 
4. To undo a 
x, do we divide a 
x by a or a 
x 
by x? (Since a . x means a times x we divide by 
a, the multiplier.) 

5. .How do we undo 3 -2? 8 x 4? Divide 6 by 3; divide 
32 by 8? 
6. In terms of these symbols, can you define dfvision? 
An understanding of a -x = b will be helpful to the pupll as 
he studies percenGage, and the equivalence of the two statements 
"b + a = and "a . x = b" will be of great importance in 

Chapter 6. Therefore, an emphasis on understanding the relation-
ship between a, x, and b is desirable.

3-80 -The Number -One. 
PaKe &. In tNs lesson emphasla should be placed not only on 
special properties of the operations with 1 but also on the 
closure, associative and commutative properties. The fact that 
there is more than one way to represent the number 1 ia empha-
sized in the first exercise. Of course this gives the teacher 
an opportunity to review the concept of numeral as a name for a 
number and not the number itself. Pupils think of the operation 
with numbers so frequently that they forget that (4 -3) is 
really another way to represent 1. 

A class discussion of the lesson summary In symbols may be 
profitable for many pupils. Of course some other letter in place 
of C could be used as practice for pupils in translating symbols 
into words. Be sure that the pupils have the ideas before 
attempting symbolism. Pupilat translations of the mathematical 


sentences could be somewhat as follows: 

(a) The counting numbers (c) are obtained by starting 
wlth 1 and repeatedly adding 1. 
(b) If any counting number Is multiplied by I, the product 
is the same number. 
(c) If any counting number is divlded by 1, the quotient 
is the same counting number. 
(d) If any counting number is divided by the same number, 
the quotient is 1. 
(e) The number one, raised to any power which is a counting 
number, equals 1.

3-9. The Number Zero. 
Pa~ex.The purpose of this lesson is to understand why we can 
or cannot perform the fundamental operations with zero. 

It is important for pupils to understand that zero is a 
perfectly good number and that it does not mean "nothing." The 
pupil should see that, In addition and subtraction, zero obeys 
the same laws as the counting nmbera. 

In explaining the product of c . 0 and 0 . c, It may be 
helpful to review briefly the meaning of multipllcatlon. Such 
discussion questions might be:

2. What does 3 x 5 mean? It means 5 + 5 + 5 and not 
3 +3 +3 4-3 +3* 
3. Make up a real problem using 3 x 5. he price of 3 
pencils at 5$ each.) 
4. What does 5 x 3 mean? (1t mema 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3.) 
5. Make up a real problem using 5 x 3. h he price of 5 
pencils at 3$ each.) 
After such questlon4, zero may be Introduced In the discussion 
as multiplicand and multiplier, since 5 a O = 0 


5 by the 
commutative property for multiplication. 
In case of division, puplls should understand why we divide 
0 by a and do not divide a by 0. It may be desirable to 
use several examples so that the pupils will see that should 
be 0 and % is not the name of any whole number. 

Some or the pupils may be interested in why we do not define 
or some other number. They should understand that it

% = 1 

would be out of harmony with the fact that zero times any number 
equals zero. 
The translations Into words of the symbolic statements 
concerning zero can be somewhat as follows: 

(a) If zero is added to any whole number, the sum is the 
same whole nmber. 
(b) If any whole number Is added to zero, the sum is the 
same whole number. 
(c) If zero is subtracted from any whole number, the differ-

ence is the same whole number. 

(d) If any whole number is multiplied by zero, the product 
is zero. 
(e) If zero is multiplied by any whole number, the product 
is zero. 
(f) If the product of any two whole numbers is zero, then 
one of the whole numbers Is zero or both are zero. 
(g) If zero is divided by any counting number, the quotlent 
is zero. 
(h) Zero cannot be used as a divisor.

3. The error is in the generalization to c in part (I). 
If a . b = c, a or b does not need to be c. 
Example: 2 . 2 = 4. This exercise shows the error 
that may be made by making a generalization on a few 
cases.

March 27, 1951? 
Show with one example that the set of numbers from 10 
to 15 Is not closed under addition. 
4. Answer true or false: The identity for multiplication 
in the set of whole numbers is zero. 
5. If K is a counting number then 0 = ? 
6. Apply the commutative property of addition to: (4.5) + 6 
7. We are uslng the property when we say 
that 3a + 5a Is another way of writing (3 + 5)ma. 
8. If the product of 5 and a certain number fa zero, then 
that number must be: (a) 1 (b) 0 (c) 5 
(d) None of the above 
9. When the number one is divided by any counting number n, 
the answer is alwaya: (a) 0 (b) 1 (c) n 
(d) None of the above 
10. Which of the following numerals are names of counting 
numbers? (10)~~14 0 (7UIten 5.* XIV
