FACTORING AND PRrnS

Page -151. It is important that in the beginning the pupils 
experiment with numbers and at the same time become accustomed 
to the equivalent terms "divisible by" and "multiple of." To 
emphasize this and to give the initial development of the Sieve 
of Eratosthenes, the pupil is first asked to cross out the 
multiples of 2, except for 2 itself, in the list of numbers 
up to 31; then the multiples of 3. 
Page 152. As a class exercise, the Sieve for the numbers up to 
100 Is to be constructed. It will save class time for the teacher 
to have prepared on ditto sheeta the numbers from 1 to 100 
arranged in rows of ten. If the teacher wishes, the next hundred 
numbers might also be included. The pupils should check their 
copies carefully and keep them for future reference. 

It should be stressed that 1 is a special number in various 
ways. First, every counting number is divisible by 1. Second, 
1 ia divialble only by itself, that is, It has only one factor. 
Because of these properties, the unique factorization theorem, 
introduced in Section 2 of this chapter, would not hold if 1 
were classified aa a prime number. 

In constructing the Sleve the students should realize that 
after crossing out the multiples of 2 (except for 2) only the 
odd numbers remain, that is, only those numbers which are not 
divisible by 2. After the aecond step, only the numbers 
1, 2, 3 and those not divisible by either 2 or 3 remain. 
After the third step, only the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5 and those not 
divisible by 2, 3, or 5 remain. After the fourth step, only 
the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and those not divisible by 2, 3, 5 or 7 
remain. This pattern contfnues. 

The students are encouraged to try to see why in the fifth 
step, involving multiples of 11, no further numbers are crossed 
out in the set from 1 to 100. Zf no student dfscovers why 


this Is so, the teacher should pass over the point since it is 

important that it be discovered in the student's own time; but 

some student may notice that any number less than 100 which is 

not a prime number must have a factor which is less than the 

aquare root of 100. Prom this it follows that, except for 1, all 
the numbers remaining In this Sieve after the fourth step will 
be prime numbers. The fourth step is the crossing out of all 
multiples of 7 other than 7. 

Sieve of Eratosthenes 
for the numbers from 1 through 100: 

for the numbers from 100 through 200:

Remember! 1 is not a prlme number.

5-2. Factors. 
The purposes of this section are to develop understandings of 
the terms "factor, " "camplete factorization,It "composite number, 

I' 

and of the Unique Factorization Property. Notice that the 
definition of factor includes zero; thus zero has factors. 
Problem 4 of Exercises 5-2 serves as a basia of a discussfon 
of zero. 
Page 157. We do not consider it mandatory that pupils use 
exponents. They should be encouraged, however, to use them where-
ever it is reasonable to do so. 

As a matter of interest, the Unlque Factorization Property 
is usually referred to as the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. 
Notice that in complete factorization for a prime number 
like 17 only one factor is written, as: 17 = 17. 

The definition given of a composite number is felt to be 
the easleat to understand of various possible ones. Some teachers 
may prefer to stress the definitions in terms of number of factors 
since this does have some unifying effect. If this is the case, 
the counting numbers would be classified as follows: 

a. The number 1 which has just one factor, namely, Itself. 
b. The prlme numbers which have just two factors; namely, 
1 and the number Itself 
c. The composite numbers which have more than two factors. 
[pages 154-1571 

It Is important to notice that every counting number comea under 
one of theae headings. 

Notice that the definition is given of complete 
factorization, not* complete factorization, since the order 
of the prime factors may vary. 

fn the previous edition of this section, diagrams of 

numbers were considered in connection with factoring. Teacher 
reaction was mixed, some finding it very useful and others 
of no assistance at all. Teacher ~eactlonsseem to indicate 

that aome students acqulre better understanding of factorleation 
by use of theae diagrams, others are confused by them. Since 
also it was felt that the development of this method might be 
eaeler if the teacher was not bound by a text, we are confining 
the description of this method to the teacher's commentary. 

EBsAcally, we can represent a product by the diagram 
2 3 6 
Oh0 where the 3 aaaociated with the line is the 
multiplier, which "takes 2 into 6. " The arrow indicates the 
direction in which the multiplication goea. 
2 6 24

3 4

Similarly o ,O o represents the product 
(2x 3) x 4. 

Wen the three different complete lactorlzations of 18 could 
be represented by the following dlagram. Notice that all the 
factors of 18 also appear in the diagram 

In making a diagram you may suggest to the pupils that it Is 
beat first to make a list of all the factors of the number and to 
arrange them from the smallest to the largeat. For 12 this would 
be 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Then start with 1 and continue to build a 
chain so that the second number is divisible by the preceding nun-


ber, and so on. Thus, one chain would consist of 1, 2, 4, and 
12; another chain would consist of 1, 3, 6, and 12; and the last 
chain would be 1, 2, 6, and 12. In eech of these chains, taking 
any pair, the second is divisible by the firat and there Is no 
factor between them. We could not go from 1 to 4 alnce there 
is the factor 2 between 1 and 4. Remember that one of the 
rules of the game is that there may be no other factor between 

successive numbers. 

The diagrams for the numbers from 1 through 20 are 
ahown here : 


Some teachers may be interested in pursuing the investigation 
of theae diagrams a little further. TAe following examples are 
included for this purpose. Also, a few of your very gifted pupils 
may gain better understandings about numbers from these examples. 
However, it is felt that if presented to all students, the extra 
time used nay not justify the results.

9. Divisibility is a property of number. It is the number whick 
is divisible by another number. The numeral is a way of writ 
ing the number. In base ten, a numeral which represents an 
even number ends with an even niunber; in base five this Is 
not necessarily so. This is illustrated in Exercise 8. 
+lo, Some of the items in the table will be :

5-3. Divisibility. 
Page 160. The purpose of this section is to facilitate the 
discovery of factors of numbers by inspection of the decimal 
system numerals which represent them. Since we need be concerned 
only with prime factors, we confine ouraelvea chiefly to 2,3 
and 5. At this point in the pupil's development It was felt that 
the discovery of patterns would be more meaningful than the 
discussion dissecting the numeral according to the powers of 
ten. Some teachers may prefer the treatment in the supplementary 
unit on divisibility since it gives a little more insight into 
the reasons back of these patterns. 

It is hoped that most of the pupils will go a little further 
than merely seeing that as far a8 the table goes, every number 
divisible by 3 has a sum of digits which is als~divisible by 3. 
They should look at the transition where the tens digit increases 
by 1, as is suggested In Problem 3. Some may be able to go 
further and see that where the hundreds digit increases by 1, 
the tens digit decreases by 9 and the unit digit by 7, leaving 
a net decrease of 9 + 7 -1 = 15 which is a multiple of 3. 
Some pupils may even go further and notice that if one takes the 
sum of the digits, the same properly holds. 

It ia not intended that great stress shall be laid here on 
tests for divisibility in other bases but It Is very important 
that the pupils realize that the te sts given here depend on the 
way the number is written (that is, the aystem of numeration 

[page 1601

used). Just a little discussion of tests for other number systems 
seems to be the best way to emphasize this point.

4. For divisibility by 5 one needs only to see that when 5 is 
added to a number whose unfta digit is 0, the sum has units 
digit 5; if 5 is added to a number whose units digit is 5, 
the sum has units digit 0. %is pattern repeats to show 
the test for all numbers. 
5. The following table can be made for multiples of 9: 
Multiple of 9 9 18 rl 36 45.. -90 99 id... 
Sum of digits 9 9 9 9 99189 
6. A counting number will be divisible by 6 if and only if It is 
divlaible by both 2 and 3. Hence the test is that it must 
be even and the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. 
7. If a number is divisible by 15 it must be divisible by both 
3 and 5, and conversely. Hence the test 1s that Its laet 
; 

digit must be one of 0 and 5 and the sum of its digits must 
i be a multiple of 3. 

8. a. Since the last digit ia odd, the number is odd. 
b. 'ihe number 1s 400 in the decimal system and hence Is 
even. The brlght pupil might notice that the number 
3 2

is even since it can be written in the form 7 + 7 + 7+1 
which is the sum of an even number of odd numbers. 

c. Here the number in the decimal system 1s 259 which is 
odd. The bright student might notice that it may be 
3

written 6 + 62 + 6 + 1 which is the sum of 1 and 
three even numbera; hence is odd. 


d. Here the number in the decimal system la 40 which is 
even; or it may be shorn even by the same kind of 
argument as in part b. 
9. If a number is written in the system to the base seven, its 
last digit is zero if and only if it is divisible by seven, 
but it need not be divisible by ten. To test divisibility 
by 3 write the first few multiples of three in the 
system to the base seven as follows: 
Number to the base seven 3 6 12 15 21 24 30 33 36 42 
Sum of the digits 36 3 6 3 6 3 612*6 
"Notice that 12 is also written in the system to the base 
seven. Here when the first digit increases by 1, the 
second digit decreases by 4 giving a net decrease of 3. Hence 
the same test for divisibility by 3 works both in the 
decimal system and in the system to the base seven. 
10, If a number is written in the number system to the base twelve 
and has zero as Its last digit it must be divisible by 12 
but need not be divisible by 10. It will be divisible by 
if its last digit Is one of 0,3,6,9. This may be shown In 
the same way that we tested for divisibility by 5 in the 
decimal system, since the pattern 3,6,9,0 repeats in the 
sequence of multiples of 3 written to the base twelve. 

11. A number written to the base seven will be divfsible by 6 if 
the sum of its digits is divislble by 6. This is apparent 
from the table given for exercise 9 if we notice that every 
other sum of digits Is even, 
12. A number written in the decimal system will be divisible by 
4 if -one of the following holds : 
a. the last digit is one of 0,4,8 and the tens digit is even. 
b. the last digit is 2 or 6 and the tens digit 1s odd. 
This can be seen from the pattern in which the muLtlples 
of 4 fall. Also, since any multiple of 100 is divislble 
by 4, we could also say that a number is divisible by 4 
if the number represented by the last two digits is divisible 
by 4.

5-4. Greatest Common Factor. 
The following skills and understandings should be developed 
through this aectlon : 

1. To identify the common factors of several numbers. 
2. To find the greatest common factor of several numbers in 
two ways--by listing the factors of each and by using a 
complete factorization of each number. 
It is recommended that the abbreviation (G.c.F.) not be 
used in thls section. Use the complete phrase "greatest common 
factor" in order to fix the meaning of the concept in the minds 
of the pupils. 

Explain that if something is "common" to several things, then 
one meaning is that they are similar in some way. If two numbers 
have a certain number as a factor, we say that factor Is common 
to both. 

Provide drill on finding the greateat common factor by listing 
all factors to ensure that pupfls have a thorough understanding 
of the meaning of the term. Some students may discover the method 
of finding the greatest common factor by complete factorization 
before it is introduced in problem 14, but if they do not dlscover 
it, do not "push" them into this prematurely. Students should 
be encouraged to use "short divisioni' when the divisor is less 
than ten. 

Discussion Exercises 5-4. Page 166. 

14-16. Method -of fin din^ -the Greateat Common Factor & 
Complete Factorization, This is a procedure for computing the 
greatest common factor but it is not intuitive. The method of 
the definition (listing all the factors, etc. ) should be used 
in class until the concept is fixed in the minds of the pupils, 

Illustration of Method: Find the greatest common factor of 

24 and 60. 
First, find a complete factorlzatlon of each number: 
24=23 x3 

2

60=2 ~3x5 


The factor 2 occurs three times in the complete factorlzation of 
24 and twice for 60; hence, 2 can occur at most twice for 60; 
hence, 2 can occur at most twice in any factor common to both 24 
and 60. The factor 3 occurs just once in each, and hence can 
occur at most once in any common factor. The number 5 is not 
a factor of 24, and hence cannot occur In any common factor. 
Hence the greateat common factor is z2 x 3 -12. Notice that 
the power of each prime factor of the greatest common factor is 
the smaller of the powers to which it occurs in the two given 
numbers. 

Surmhary -of Nethod: (1) Find a complete factorization of 
each number. (2) Pick out the primes which occur in -all (every 
one) of these factorizations, (3) For each prime picked In (2), 
write the -smallest power of it which occurs in any of the factor-
izations. (4) Multiply all the powers written in (3); this 
product is the greatest common factor. 

The pupils will find it easier to pick out the primes and ex-
ponents in steps (2)and (3) above if the original numbers are 
written in a column with the complete factorization of each 
number to the right of the number. 

16. h. This exercise gives the pupils an opportunity to 
establish a procedure for searching for factors of numbers 
when they cannot guess them. It is time consuming, and 
may be omitted if time is not avaflable for it. 
In factoring 1173, remfnd the pupils of the test for 
divisibility by 3 and obtain 1173 = 3 x 391. Far the 
number 391, we try the successfve primes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 
17, to find 391 = 17 X 23. Review the reasons for trying 
only the primes--i.e. for skipping 9, 15, and all the even 
numbers except 2. Point out that, since 20 20 = 400 
is larger than 391, it is only necesadry to try the primes 
less than 20 (391 cannot be the product of two factors each 
of which Is larger than 20). In general, if the prlrnes 
are tried in order of magnftude, one should stop when the 

quotient is less than or equal to the divfaor..

55 Remainders -in Division. 

This eectlon serves a dual purpose: to help review basic 
understandings about division and to separate the section dealing 
with greatest common factor andleast common multiple. 

Also, this sectfon should help strengthen the pupils1 ideas 
concerning divisibility. Weusethe idea of the kclidean 
division algorithm, but wedo not introduce the term "algorithm." 

[pages 168-1691 


It I8 not necessary to confuse pupils with terms not needed in 
understanding the basic ideas hi8cussed. 

Page 170. The divfaion relation should be discussed following 
the introductory work and review. It is Important that the 
pupil understand the relationships among a, b, q, and R 

lntheexpreesion a= (b 

q) +R. If careisused to 
relate the~esymbols with the terms dividend, diviaor, quotient, 
and remafnder, the pupil should not find it difficult to use 
the symbol fom with understanding. 
The pupil should understand that division always involves 
a remainder. We may not always write a zero remainder, but the 
importance of recognizing zero as a remainder should not be 
minimized. It should be pointed out to students that when the 
remainder 16 zero we can use the division relation to express 
divisibility.

i 9. a. Consider first two of the lines. Since they are different 
lines and are not parallel, they 
intersect in exactly one point as 
sketched, !he third line either goes through this point 
of intersection or it doesn't. The two cases are illus-
trated belaw, 

1 intersection 


b. c. In part a ,we discussed the cases where no two of 
the lines are parallel; these two cases are also possible 
in parts b and c. We have left to consider the caae 
where at least two lines -are parallel. The third line 
is either parallel to both of them or to nelther of them. 
me two cases are illustrated below. 
b, 2 intersections c. 0 lnteraectlons 

19, Since a, b, f, g are four different numbers and g la a 
factor of both a and b, we must have g ( a, g ( b, 
Also, f is a factor of both a and b (different from 

g) and g Is the largest common factor of a and b. 
Thus f < a, f < b and f ( g. Illustrate with a -12 
b = 18, f = 3, g = 6. 
20. If the numbers are allowed to be equal, all four of them 
may be the same so that there may be no Ineguallties among 
them. Illustrate with a = b = f = g = 4, 
22. a. If we conaider the experiment of drawing one piece of 
paper from the hat, there are 50 possible outcomes: the 
numeral drawn could represent any one of 1, 2, 3, ..,, 50. 
Of these 50 outcomes there are five favorable (10, 20, 30, 
40, 50). Thus the probability of a favorable outcome is 
2=J-

50 10' 
b, Of the 50 outcomea, there are 10 which are favorable 
(the numeral drawn represent a number divisible by 5), 
namely: 5, 10 1, . 5. Thus the probability of a 
favorable outcome is lO/5O = l/5. 
The explanation for c and d follows from above. 

23. a. Of the 50 possible outcomes, there are 50 in which 
the numeral drawn represents a number which la divisible 
by 1, namely: 1, 2, 3, ..., 50. Since every numeral 
represents a number divisible by 1, only one draw is 
needed, 

b. For 2, we would have to draw enough times to draw all 
numerals representing numbers not divisible by 2; 
1, 3, 5, ..., 49. There are twenty-five such numerals. 
One more, the twenty-sixth, -must be a number divisible 
by 2. 
c. Of the 50 poaslble outcomes, there are 16 in which the 
numeral drawn mpreaents a number which is divisible by 
3, namely: 3, 6, 9, . . ., 48. To be -sure of drawing at 
leaat one of these numerals, we would have to draw enough 
times to draw all the other numerals and then one more; 
i.e. (50 -16) + 1 = 35 draws. 
24. a. Each of the sets haa eleven elements (or members). One

Least Common Wltiple (L.c.M.) 
Skills and understandings to be developed: 
5-7 

1. To find common multiples of several numbers, 
2, To find the least common multiple of several numbers in 
two ways--by listing the multiples of each and by using 
a complete factorization of each number. 

It is recommended that the abbreviation (L.c.M. ) nof be 
used in this section. Use the complete phrase "least common 
multiple" In order to fix the meaning of the concept in the 
minds of the pupils. 

'Ihe treatment of zero as a multiple must be done carefully. 
mat zero is a multiple of any whole number is introduced here 
so that we may be consistent in the definition of an even 
number, i.e., "a number divisible by 2, " or "a number ending 
in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8." A careful treatment of zero should help 
clarify some of the special properties of zero. 

That the "least common multiple" is the smallest counting 
number la an Important distinction. Otherwise, for any members 
of a set of numbers, the least common multiple will be zero. 
Since zero as a least cmon multiple is not particularly 
useful to us in mathematics we choose to use the least counting 
number in a set of common multiples. Provide drill on finding 
the least common multiple by listing multiples, This provides 
some basic drill in multiplication and division. Problem 13 
Is designed to help students 'tdiscover''a shorter way to find 
the least common multlple. Do not insist on the use of this 
method at this tlme, but encourage the students to use it if they 
understand why it works. 


Method of fl~dingthe Least Common Multiple b~ Complete Factorization.

---. 

&ample: Find the least common multiple of 12 and 18. First 
find a complete factorization of each number: 
12 -22 X 3 

2

18=2x3. 

2

Any number which Is a multiple of 12 must have 2 as a factor 

and also 3 as a factor. Any number which Is a multiple of 18 

2

must have 2 as a factor and aleo 3 as a factor. Thus a 
number which is a common multiple of 12 and 18 must have among 
its factors all of the following: 

2

22, 3, 2, 3.

A number which haa 2 as a factor certatnly has 2 as a factor,

Exercises 5-8. 

The purpose of this section is to swnmarize in general the 
new material Introduced in this chapter. Rather than produce 
a glossary, which might confuse pupils with definitions "out 
of context," we chose briefly to discuss the new terms. 
Attention 1s drawn to the terms which we wish to stress by 
writing them out in capital letters, 

TPle diagram used in the introductory paragraph of this 
section might be discussed in class at some length to assure 
pupils' understanding of the relations among the sets of numbers 
included here, Pupils should understand, for example, that the 
set of prime numbers is a subset of the set of whole numbers 
and a subset of the counting numbers;similarly, for the set of 
composite numbers and the number ''one." They should also under-
stand that the number "zero" is a subset of the whole numbers 
but ia not a subset of the counting numbers, Care should be 
used to explain these ideas. ft is not intended that the word 
If subsets" be introduced, because the ideas Involved in the 
diagram can be discussed wfthout using set terminology. 

Another purpose of this section Is to fix in the pupils* 
minds the differences between the greatest common factor and the 
least common multiple. Note that we have avoided using the 
abbreviations L.C.F. and L.C.M. in the pupilst materials, 

[page 1831 


It is recommended that these abbreviations not be used at this 

time. 
The discussion should emphasize again that the greatest

I 

conunon factor of two different numbers Is Brnaller than one or both

/

i of the numbers. Also, the least common multiple of two different 
1 numbers is greater than one or both of the numbers.

3 2

Then rs = 2 x 5 X 7 x 2x5 x 13

and G.C.F. times L.C.M. = 2 x 5 x 2 x 5 x 7 x 13.

never be greater than the largest number of the set of 
numbers because a factor of a number is always less than 
a multiple of the number unless the multiple is zero. 

c. No. The L.C.M. of the members of a set of numbers can 
never be less than the largest member of the set of 
numbers. 
me least common multiple of two numbers is at least as big 

as the larger of the two numbers (since the L.C,M, is a 

multiple of the larger number). The greatest common factor 

of two numbers is no larger than the smaller of the two 

numbers (since the Q.C.F. is a factor of the smaller number). 
If the least common multiple and greatest common factor are 

equal, the larger and smaller number must also be equal.

Illustrate with 4 and 6, locating the L.C.M. and 

G.C.F. on the number line; then use 4 and 4. 
a. No. It is not possible to have exactly four numbera 
between two odd numbers. Between any two odd primes 
there is alwaye an odd number of numbers. If they 
are consecutive odd primes all the numbers between 
would have to be composite. 
b, Yes. For example, between 23 and 29 there are 
exactly 5 composite numbers; 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. 
a. 135, 222, 783, and 1065 ape all divisible by three. 
b. 222 is the only number divisible by six 
c. 135 and 783 are divisible by nine. 
d. 135 and 1065 are divisible by five. 
e. 135 and 1065 are divisible by fifteen. 
f, None of the numbers are divisible by four. 

Many different answers should be expected from the atudents; 
in a way his reasons for hi8 answer are more important than 
the answer itself. The most obvious answer is that as far 
as multiplication is concerned, the prime numbers are the 
building blocks of all counting numbers, since any counting 
number can be expressed a8 a product of prime numbers. If 
we how a complete factorizatLon of a number, then we can 
find all its factors. Also from complete factorization8, the 

Q.C.F. and L.C.M. of set8 of numbers may also be found. 
BRAINBUSTER, The pattern is a five-pointed star. 

There is no greatest prime number. 

*The following proof ia for the information of the teacher. 
It is not expected that any except the most brilliant 
students would profit by it in the 7th grade* 

To show there is no largest prlme number, we will show 
that If p is any prlme, there is another prlme larger than 

p. Denote by M the product of all the primes less than or 
equal top: M= 2 X 3 X5 X7 X11 X ... Xp, 

men M + 1 Is certainly larger than p and M + 1 has at 

leaat one prime factor (it may be a prime). kt M + 1 

does not have any of the primes 2, 3, 5, 7, ..., p as a 

factor since dlvisfon by any of these primes leaves a 

remainder of 1. Thus all the prlme factora of M + 1 

are larger than p, and hence p ie not the largest prime. 

Since p was an arbitrary prime, there la no largest 
prime.
