Chapter 2 

Introduction 

For this unit little background is needed except familiarity 
with the nunher symbols and the basic operations with numbers. 
The purpose of the unit is to deepen the pupilis understmding of 
the decimal notation for whole numbers, especially with regard to 
plzce value, and thus to help him delve a little deeper into the 
reasons for the procedures, which he already knows, for carrying 
out the addition and multiplication operations. One of the best 
ways to accomplish this is to consider systems of nmber notations 
using bases cther than ten. Since, in using a new base, the 
pupil must necessarily look at the reasons for "carrying" and the 
other mechanical procedures in a new light, he should gain deeper 
insight into the decimal system. A certain amount of computation 
in other systems is necessary to "fix1'these ideas, but such 
computation should not be regarded as an end in itself. Some of 
the pupils, however, may enjoy developing a certain proficiency 
in using new bases In computing. 

Perheps the most important reason for introducing ancient 
spbolisms for numbers is to contrast them with our decimal system, 
in which not only the symbol, but its position, has significance. 
It should be shown, as cther systems are presented, that positlon 
has some significance in them also, The Roman System has a start 
in this directior: in that XL represents a different r?wriber from 
LX, but the start was s very primitive one. The Babylonians also 
made use of position, but lacked a symbol for zero until about 
200 B.C. The Babylonian symbol '$2 denoted the absence of a

If 

flgure but apparently was not used in computation. The numeral 
zero is necessary in a positional system. In order for the pupils 
to appreciate the important characteristics of our system or 
writing numbers, the following table may be discussed. 


Base Place Value Zero 
Egyptian Ten No No 
hbylonian Sixty Yes Llrnited 
meaning 
Roman Varied No, but it has No 
positional value 
Decimal Ten Yes Yes 

Pupils should not be expected to memorize ancient symbolism. It 
is recommended that little time be spent on the use of the symbols 
themselves. 

It is especially important to distinguish between a number 
and the symbols by which it is represented. Some of the proper-
ties usually connected with a number are really properties of Its 
notatlon. The facts that, in decimal notatlon, the numeral for 
a number divisible by 5 ends in 5 or 0, and that has an unending

7 

decimal equivalent (0.333.. . ) ,are il1ust:rations. Most of the 
properties with which we deal are properties of the numbers 
themselves, and are entirely independent of the notation in which 
they are represented. Examples of such properties or numbers are: 
2 + 3 = 3 + 2; the number eleven is a prime number; and six is 
greater than five. The distinction between a nunber and the 
notation In which it is expressed should be emphasized whenever 
there Is opportunity. 

An attempt has been made to use "number" and "numeral"wlth 
precise meaning in the text. For example, "numerals" are wrftten, 
but "numbers1' are added. A numeral is a written symbol. A number 
is a concept. Later In the text it may be cumbersome to the 
point of annoyance to speak of "adding the numbers represented 
by the numerals written below." In such case the expression may 
be elided to "adding the numbers below." 

At several points, numbers are represented by collections of 
xis. Exercises of this kind are important, because they show the 
role of the base in grouping the x's, as well aa the significance 
of the digits in the numeral for the number. 


Suggested Time Schedule 

It is important that only enough time be spent on the various 
sections to secure the understandings desired. The historical 
symbols themselves are not Important. Neither are the numerals in 
other bases valuable in themselves, but the Ideas that they help 
to clarify are important. 

Familiarity with the subject matter is an important factor In 
a smooth presentation, Teachers report that a second experience 
with this material is much easier than the first. The lesson 
moves more rapidly, apparently, as the teacher gains confidence 
in the subject matter presented. 

Homogeneously grouped classes undoubtedly will alter the 
suggested schedule since the more able students can complete the 
chapter in less time while less able students may require a consid-
erably longer period of time on various sections. The following 
schedule may then be adapted to local needs, taking into consi-
deration the length of class periods and other factors. It 
should be remembered that extra time spent on this chapter will 

necessarily reduce the number of days available for later important 
chapters.

2-1. History of Numerals. 
Pa~e21. The purpose of the historical material is to trace the 
continuing need for convenient symbols and for a useful way of 
writlng expressions for numbers. The idea of "one-to-one" corre-
sporrdence is introduced. It Is developed later and should not be 
defined here where the emphasis is upon numerals rather than upon 
number. Egyptian symbolism is Introduced to familiarize the 
pupils with one of the first Important systems of notation. Do 
not consume an excessive amount of time in discussing the Egyptian 
or Babylonian systems. 
Page -22, The Babylonians were among the first to use place value. 
The base sixty system is mentioned because of later reference to 
ft, particularly In measurement. There is evidence that the 
Babylonians also used symbols like 03 but there is no need to 
introduce these to the pupils. No pupil should be required to 
memorize ancient symbolism except in the case of Roman numerals. 
Paue 3.The Roman system may be stressed because of its conth-

ued use. Note that the subtracting prfnciple was a late develop-
ment. It may be pointed out that computation in ancient symbolism 
was complex and somet?mos very difficult. Because of this, 
various devices were used, such as the sand reckoner, counting 
table, and abacus. After decimal numerals became known, algo-
rithms were devised and people were able to calculate with symbols 
alone. There was much oppoaltlon In Europe to the introduction 
and use of Hindu-Arabic numerals, especially on the part of the 
abaclsta. As the new system became accepted, the abacus and 
other computing devices slowly disappeared in Europe.

2-2. The Decimal System. 
Pa~e26, The Illustration of grouplng in tens suggests a method 
useful in mental calculation as 37 + 62 is 3 tens + 6 tens + 7 + 2 
which Is 99. Note that parenthesea are used to ahow that certain 
combinations are to be considered as representing a single numeral 
In a later chapter a different uae of parentheses will be dls-
cussed in greater detail. lkphasize the value represented by a 
digit and the value of position in decimal notation. 

Rnphasize the importance of the Invention of a useful system 
which lends itself easily to calculation. The efficiency of the 
decimal system lies in a combination of factors. 

1. Only a few symbols are needed, no matter how large or 
small the number expressed. Some students may observe 
that we use ten symbols while the Babylonians used just 
two and the Egyptians and the Romans each used 7. How-
ever, in the decimal system no additional symbols are 
ever needed as larger numbers are Introduced; this Is 
not true of the other systems. 
2. Place value in which each position corresponds to a 
power of the base is of importance In a aystem used for 
calculation. 
3. The concept of zero as a place holder Is essential in the 
development of a place value system. 
Page 28. The reading and writing of numerals may be treated a8 a 
review, or if needed, as a thorough study, depending on the needs 
of pupils. Some pupils may know and understand this material 
completely. Others may have a very limited proficiency in this 
area. 

A class discussion might deal with the Following: 

Suppose we used systematic names for numerals such as "two 
tenst1for twenty, "two tens, one" for twenty-one, "ten, one1'for 
eleven, and ''ten, two1'for twelve. How many different, basic 
words would be needed to name all counting numbers up to a 
trillion? eme ember that a numeral like "one hundred, three tens, 
sixN is made up of basic words used many times in other numerals.) 
There are fifteen essential words: "one, two, three,... ..., ten,

Pa~e30. Exponents are introduced here in a situation which 

shows clearly their usefulness for concise notation. Purfher-
more, their use serves to emphasize the role of the base and of 
position. This role will be more fully utilized in the sections 
to follow.

2-4. Numerals in Base Seven. 
Page z,The purpose of teaching systems of numeration In bases 
other than ten is not to produce facility in calculating with 
such systems. A study of an unfamiliar system aids in under-
standing a familiar one, just as the study of a foreign language 
aids us in understanding our own. The decimal system is so 
familiar that its structure and the ideas involved In its algo-
rithms are easily overlooked. In this section attentfon is 
focused on numerals, rather than on numbers. 
Page 2. Questions may arise about the notation for a numeral 
to base seven. We do not wrlte ''157" because the symbol "7" does 
not occur in a system of numeration to this base. Replacing the 
numeral by the written word emphasizes this fact. 
Iater in the chapter and in succeeding chapters, some classes 
may agree to indicate the base, as dlfferent systems of nwneratlon 
are introduced, by a numeral In decimal notation. They may agree 
that they will regard the subscript in this case as alyays based 
on ten. Thus they may write for 25seventhe expression 25?; for 

latwelve the expression g12; and for llOtwo, 1102 
After the pupils have had practice in grouping by sevens, 
introduce counting. Fuplls enjoy counting in turn, and helping

them fill in missing parts of the list on page 35 orally with 
perhaps a recorder at the board.

No; you cannot tell merely by glanclng at the numerals. 
You could tell by converting each number to base ten. 
There Is another method which Is aharter and has much

12seven 5 (1x7) + (2 xl)

The first; term is divisible by two but the second term 
is not divisible by two; hence the sum is not divisible 
by two. Note that the digit in the units place of the 
last expression in the display L + 2, is the sum of 
the digits of 12seven and this sum is not dfvisible by 
two. This Is a general rule for base seven numerals.

Addition, Base Ten 

Pupils should be helped to observe the symmetry of the table 
with respect to the diagonal. They all notice that 8 + 6 = 
6 + 8, for example,and that this is true for any pair of numbers. 
Uter they will learn that this la the comutative property of 
addition. It is suggested that the word commutative not be used 
at this time. 

If puplls how the facts, no time should be wasted on the 
table after its characterlstlcs have been discussed. 


There is no value in memorlzfng this table. The process is 
more important than the facts. The point to be emphasized is that 
numbers and number properties are independent of the numerals or 
symbols used to represent the numbers. Commutativfty holds in 
base seven as well as base ten because it is a property of numbers, 
not numerals.

often necessary to regroup ten ones as one ten, whereas in base 
seven we regroup seven ones as one seven.

Page 48. Pupils in general find it easier to change from base 

seven to base ten numerals than the reverse, This section gives 
much detail in order to provide help to pupils who may have 

trouble. 

Ask for the highest power of seven which is contained in 
the number given in base ten numeration. For example, consider 

4 3

63Sl0. Is 7 contained in 63410? or (34310)?

or (2401~~) Is 7 
After we have taken as many 343101s as possible from 63410, how 
much remains? The next power of 7 is 72. How many 491015 are 
contained in 29lI0? Finally, how many 7's, and how many 1's are 
left?

Some pupils will see that the 6 ones are found ffrst when 
74 groups of 7 are taken away. These groups of 7 are then put 
together in groups of 7 sevens with 4 groups left for the numeral 
in the 7 place. The process is repeated to find the digits for 
successive places in the numeral.

use Is IIten" for historical rather than mathematical reasons. 
Some mathematicians have suggested that a prime number such as 
7 has certain advantages. The Duodecimal Soclety of America,

of twelve as the best number base. Information about the duo-

2-8. The-Blnaq -and Duodecimal Systems. 
Page 56. Junior high school pupfls are often intrigued by a more 
extended discussion of computers than is found in the text. This 
is something you might brlng out in classroom discussion. For 
example, you might say, "NOW that we have seen how a row of 
lights may be used to represent a number using the binary system 
of nwneratfon, how might we design a simple adding machine?" 
It is unimportant and quite beside the point, at thls stage, 
for the pupil to be concerned with the electrlcal problems of 
design. He can, however, dlscover what such a machine might look 
like and what it must do, In the process he may galn some under-
standing of the fact that the binary system of numeration enables 
one to reduce computational problems to purely mechanical and 
electrlcal ones in a rather slmple way. 

Suppose we wish to design a machine to add any two numbers 
whlch can be written In the binary scale with no more than 5 
digits. We will need three rows of lights. 

c O00G00 

[pages 54-561 


L 

The numbers to be added will be entered into the machine by 
turning on approppiate lights in rows A and B. The sum is to 
be shown in Row C. The switches which operate the lights in 
Row C are to be wired In such a way that they are activated 
by the lights In rows A and 3. Our task is to deacrlbe just 
when a light in Row C is to be on and when it Is to be off. 

Consider a few simple addition problems, and observe how 
they appear both in binary numerals and in llghts. Suppose we 
wiah to add 10IOt, and lootwo 

.LUAU n VwWw

two 

lootwo 

AAlVtwo 

From this problem we can recognize two requirements for the 
' wlring of our machlne. 

I. In a given column, if the lights in both Rows A and 
3 are off then the light in that column In Row C 
should also be off. 
I 
I 
2. In a given column, if one of the two lights in Rows A 
and 3 is on then the llght in that column in Row C 
should turn on. 
Now consider what happens when we add 10lltwoand 10ltwo. 
Here we need to "carry,fl and our machine is not equipped to do 

this. It doesn't mow what to do if two lights In a given 
column are on. We need one more row of lights; a !1 carrying row." 
The machine must look like this: 

with Row X used only for carrying. The second addition looks 
like this: 


When -we turn on lights in Rows A and 3 as shown, the 
indicated lights in Rows C and X must turn on automatlcally. 
'Il~uswe see a third requlrement for our wlring. 

3 If, in a given column, any -two lights In Rows A, B, 
or X are on then the light in Row C will remain off 
and the light in Row X in the column mediately to 
the left will turn on. 

Requirement 3 says that if we have 

then we must have 

Finally, we have 

4. If, in a given colm, all the lights in Row8 A, B, 
and X are on, then the light in Row C must go on 
and also the light in Elow X of the column immediately 
to the left is to go 'on. 
The addition 

loltwo 

would appear on the machine aa 


x 0.e.. 

A

o.... 

B 00.0. 
c 0.0.00 

and the sum 101OOtw, would appear in Row C of lights almost as 
soon as we had entered the numbers llllt, and 10ltwo in Rows A 
and B. We have designed an adding machine In the sense that 
requirements 1, 2, 3 and 4 -can be built into a box with the re-
quired rows of lfghts by means of switches and relays. The 
Fmportant thing for the pupil at this stage is not the electrical 
problem, itself, but the knowledge that the binary system of 
notation makes it possible to reduce computational problems to 
purely mechanical and electrical construction in thls rather 
simple way. 

As an extensfon of the discussfon, you might ask how we 

might use -two of these addlng machines to build a new machine 
for adding three numbers together. If we use the notation 

to Indicate two lights wired so that they are always 
lfghted or unlighted together, then such a machine could be 
diagrammed as follows 

If each of the smaller boxes within the larger box is an 
adding machine of the type described above then the large box 
is a computer which will add trlples of numbers. If the binary 
numerals of the numbers are entered in Rows I, I1 and 111, the 
sum appears in the bottom Row C. 

[page 561 


The use of binary notation in high speed computers is, of 
course, well known. The binary system is used for computers aince 
there are only two digits, and an electric mechanism Is either 
IIon" or "off." Such an arrangement is called a flip-flop 
mechanism. A number of pamphlets dfstributed by IBM, bmington 
Rand, and similar sources may be obtained by request and used 
for supplementary reading and study. "yes No -One zero" pub-
lished by Esso Standard Oil Co., 15 West Slst,, New York 19, 
Mew York is available for the asking only in states served by 
Esso. 

It ahould be of interest that the sm 11001 + 110 looks the 
same in the binary system, decimal system, and, In fact, all 
positional number systems. The meanlng, however, Is quite dif-
ferent . 

The base two has the disadvantage that, while only two 
different digfts are used, many more places are needed to express 
numbers in binary notation than in decimal, e.g., 

2000t,n = ll,lll,O1o,OOO~wo 
Pupils may be interested in the reminder method for changing 
a number from one base to another. This method of changing 25ten 
to binary notation rests on repeated diviaion by 2, to Identify 
the powera of 2 whose sum is 25. To change 25ten to base three, 
repeat divlsion by 3; to base four, divide by 4; am? ao on. 
The division is shown below for changing 25te,to binary 
notation, followed by an interpretation of the results of the 
diviaion at each stage. It will be noted that the remainder8 
in reverse order lndfcate the digits in binary numePsls. 
Recall that 2' = 1. 


Here is a set of cards which can be used in a number trick. 

Uslng the first four cards, tell a person to choose a number 
between 1 and 15, to pick out the cards containing that number and 
to give them to you. By adding the numbers at the top of the 
cards he gives you, you can tell him the number he chose. Note 
that the numerals at the top of the cards represent the powers 

By using all flve cards, you can pick out ra~neralsfrom 1 to 

31. The trick is based on the application of the binary numerals. 
Xf you have a peg board and some match sticks, you can 
represent base two nunerals on the board. Leave a hole blank for 
0 and put in a match stick for one. Represent two numbers on the 
board, one below the other, and try adding on the board. 

The twelve system uses two dlgfts more than the decimal 
aystem. From some points of view twelve is a better choice for 
a base than ten. Many products are packaged and sold by the 
dozen and by the gross. Twelve is divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 6 
as well as by 12 and 1. Ten is divisible only by 1, 2, 5, and 

10. Because it employs a larger base, large numbers may be

12. The binary system 9s extremely simple in computation. 
Large numbers are tedious to write. 
The duodecimal system may be used conveniently 
to represent large numbers. Twelve is divisib~eby 
1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12 while ten is dfvisible only by 
1, 2, 5 and 10. The twelve system requires more 
computational "facts" which will Increase difficulties 
in mernorlzing tables of addition and multiplication. 
We do use twelve In counting dozens, gross, etc., and 
in some of the common measures of length. 

14. Five welghts; 1 oz., 2 oz., 4 oz., 8 oz., may be used 
to check any weight up to 15 ounces. By adding a 16 oz. 
weight, any weight up to 31 ounces may be checked. 
15. People who work with computers often use the base eight. 
To change from binary to octal and back Is simple with 
the help of the table: 
Binary Octal 

For example, we have 

Note the grouping of numerals by threes In the binary 
numeral. The sum of the place values of digits in each 
group results in the octal numeral. Hence 

111 = (1 x 4) + (1 x 2) + (1 x 1) = 7, etc.
