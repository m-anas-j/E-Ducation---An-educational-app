Key ideas of Junior high school mathematics emphasized In 
'thls text are: structure of arithmetic from an algebraic view-
:point; the real number system as a progressing development; 
;metricand non-metric relations in geometry. Throughout the 
'materialstheas ideas are associated wlth their applications, 
.Important at this level are experience with and appreciation of 

abstract concepts, the role of definition, development of 
precise vocabulary and thought, experimentation, and proof. 
Substantial progress can be made on these concepts in the juniorhigh school. 

Fourteen experimental unita far use In the seventh and/ eighth grades were written in the summer of 1958 and tried out1 by approximately 100 teachers in 12 centers in various parts1 of the country in the ~choolyear 1958-59. On the basis of 
I teacher evaluations theee unita were revised during the summer 

of 1959 and, wlth a number of new units, were made a part of 
sample textbooks for grade 7 and a book of experimental units 
for grade 8. In the school year 1959-60, these seventh and 
eighth grade books were used by about 175 teachers in many 
parts of the country,and then further revised in the summer of 
1960. 

Mathematice is fascinating to many persons because of its 
opportunities for creation and discovery as well as for its 
utility. It is continuously and rapidly growing under the 
prodding of both Intellectual curiosity and practical applica-
tions. Even junior high school students may formulate 
mathematical questions and conjectures which they can test and 
perhaps settle; they can develop systematic attacks on 
mathematical problems whether or not the problems have routine 
OP immediately determinable solutions. Recognition of these 
important factors has played a considerable part in selection 
of content and method in thls text,

We firmly believe mathematics can and should be studiedi with success and enjoyment. ~tis our hope that this text may1 greatly assist all teachers who use it to achieve thls highlyI desirable goal.

NOTE TO TFACHERS 

I Based on the teaching experience of nearly 200 junior 

thigh school teachere In all parta of the country and the estimates!of' the authors of the revision ( including junior high school 

teachem), it is recommended that teaching time for Part 1, be 

as follows : 

Chapter Approximate number 

of days 

7 

15 

14 

15 

12 

17 

13 

13 

Total 106 

Teachers are urged to trg not to exceed theae approximate 
time allotments so that pupile will not miss the chapters at the 
end of the courae, Some classes will be able to finish certain 
chaptere Ln leas than the estimated time. 
Throughout the text, problems, topics and section8 which 
were designed for the better students are indicated by an 
aaterisk (*) . Items starred in thla mer should be used or 
omitted aa a means of adjusting the approximate time schedule.
