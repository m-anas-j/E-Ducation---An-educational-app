My Shadow 
|...........
I have a little shadow that goes 
in and out with me. 
And what can be the use of him is 
more than I can see. 
He is very, very like me from the 
heels up to the head; 
And I see him jump before me, 

When I jump into my bed. 
..

The funniest thing about him is the way 
he likes to grow 
Not at all like proper children, which is 
always very slow; 
For he sometimes shoots up taller like an 
India-rubber ball, 
And he sometimes gets so little that 
There's none of him at all. 

One morning, very early, before the 
sun I was up, 
I rose and found the shining dew 
on every buttercup; 
But my lazy little shadow, like an 
arrant sleepyhead. 
Had stayed at home behind me and was 
Fast asleep in bed. 

ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON

One day, when I was going towards my boat, I was 
surprised to see the footprint of a man on the sand. I 
stood amazed! I listened; I looked around me; I could 
neither hear nor see anything. I went up higher to look 
down; I went up the shore and down the shore, but it was 
no good; I could find no other footprint but that one. I 
went to it again to see if there were any more footprints 
and to tell if it had been my imagination. But I was not 
mistaken, for there was exactly the print of a foot — toes, 
heel, every part of a foot. I could not imagine 

how it came there. 


At last I returned home very frightened, looking behind 
me after every two or three steps, mistaking every bush 
and tree to be a man. 

When I came to my cave (which I called my castle), I 
ran inside it, as if I was being chased. I do not remember 
whether I used the ladder or went in by the hole in the 


....... 


..

rock, which I called the door. I ran for cover, faster than 
any animal could run. 

I did not sleep that night. The more I thought about 
what I had seen, the more afraid I became. I thought it 
could be one of the savages of the mainland who had 
wandered out to the sea, in a small boat. 

Luckily I was not on shore at that time, but what if he 
had seen my boat! If he had seen the boat he would have 
realised that someone lived on the island and would soon 
return with others to kill and eat me. 

And so I lay fearful for many days and prayed for 
protection. In doing so, I was much comforted and began 
going out to investigate. But even now as I went forward, I 
looked behind me frequently, because I was still 
very frightened. 

However, as I went about for two or three days and 
saw nothing I became a little bolder. I decided to go down 
to the shore again and examine the footprint once more. I 
decided to measure it with my own footmark. 

As I came closer to the footprint, I realised that it could 
not be my footprint because I had not come to this part of 
the beach since a long time. Secondly, as I placed my foot 
alongside that footprint, it seemed larger than my own. 

My fear returned! I went home again, believing that 
there was someone there. 

The island was inhabited! 

(Adapted from Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe)

Investigating the unknown 
Suspense and sense of curiosity 
Overcoming fears by scientific analysis 
A classroom library reading programme would provide for reading tastes, interests 
and abilities of all children. The teacher should ask the children to read the original 
story, Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe. They could also read other books on 
adventure, stories of family life, humour, mystery, animals stories and stories of 
people, and talk about what they have read. The exceptional qualities one finds in 
adventurers can be discussed in class. 
Take the children outdoors to see the shadows of trees and the school building. Help 
them understand the absence of shadows on a cloudy day. The teacher should 
explain the shortening and lengthening of shadows through the day. 
Since this unit is about our fears, the children could be asked to express some of their 
fears, also their unreasonable fears. They can discuss how best to deal with these 
fears. 
The two creative writing exercises have leading questions to guide the children. 
These exercises will stimulate their imagination. 
Find out how ships and planes are guided towards land? The children should 
consult the encyclopedia and share their answers with the class. To cultivate a 
taste for reading, one period a week can be devoted to using the library. Books 
appropriate to the age group can be chosen for individual reading. Children can 
be asked to write about the book they have read during the language class or 
share a story with their classmates.
