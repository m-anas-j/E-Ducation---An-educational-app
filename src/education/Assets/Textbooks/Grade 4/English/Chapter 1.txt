When summer’s in the city, 
And brick’s a blaze of heat, 
The Ice-cream Man with his little cart 
Goes trundling down the street. 

Beneath his round umbrella, 
Oh, what a joyful sight, 
To see him fill the cones with mounds 
Of cooling brown and white: 

Vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, 

Or chilly things to drink 
From bottles full of frosty-fizz, 
Green, orange, white, or pink. 

His cart might be a flower bed, 
Of roses and sweet peas, 
The way the children cluster round 
As thick as honeybees.

Folk tales 
Multi-cultural approach to food 
To avoid wastage of food 
In every country of the world, there are stories which have been handed down from 
grandparents to grandchildren or which have been sung by mothers to their babies. 
These stories are called and tell us about the customs and culture of the place 
they are set in. 
A Kerala folk tale and a Santhal folk tale have been retold in this unit. The teacher 
should encourage children to read folk tales from different parts of the country. The 
mother tongue can be given its due place by being used for discussion and 
understanding, along with teaching of English. 
The and activities should be done through imitation — the teacher 
first and then the children. Poems could be recited in groups. They may also be 
presented through dramatisation, actions etc. in the school assembly. The children 
can make big cutouts of ice creams and vegetables or dress up as particular 
vegetables or ice-cream and recite the poem. You could think of a suitable rhythm for 
the poem. 
The section can begin with a discussion started by the teacher, in this case 
on environment and recycling of waste. This can be done with the help of a 
practical example of children making paper bags from old newspaper. These 
bags could be given to the neighbourhood provision store to be used instead of 
plastic bags. Remember, paper bags are environment friendly. Old newspapers 
can also be used to make envelopes of different sizes and masks for school 
plays. 
When we use several sentences to tell others about something that we have 
seen, read, heard or done, it is called a report. For the teacher, 
along with the children, should first go through the report on Uncle Lal's farm. The 
children can then do the guided report on ice creams available in their area or on 
food, toyshops, soaps, some animal, care of pets etc. 
A creative activity should be followed by a presentation before the entire class. 
The poems, recipes, the findings of any task etc. could be done as group
