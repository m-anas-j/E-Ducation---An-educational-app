When summer’s in the city, 
And brick’s a blaze of heat, 
The Ice-cream Man with his little cart 
Goes trundling down the street. 

Beneath his round umbrella, 
Oh, what a joyful sight, 
To see him fill the cones with mounds 
Of cooling brown and white: 

Vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, 

Or chilly things to drink 
From bottles full of frosty-fizz, 
Green, orange, white, or pink. 

His cart might be a flower bed, 
Of roses and sweet peas, 
The way the children cluster round 
As thick as honeybees.

Folk tales 
Multi-cultural approach to food 
To avoid wastage of food 
In every country of the world, there are stories which have been handed down from 
grandparents to grandchildren or which have been sung by mothers to their babies. 
These stories are called and tell us about the customs and culture of the place 
they are set in. 
A Kerala folk tale and a Santhal folk tale have been retold in this unit. The teacher 
should encourage children to read folk tales from different parts of the country. The 
mother tongue can be given its due place by being used for discussion and 
understanding, along with teaching of English. 
The and activities should be done through imitation — the teacher 
first and then the children. Poems could be recited in groups. They may also be 
presented through dramatisation, actions etc. in the school assembly. The children 
can make big cutouts of ice creams and vegetables or dress up as particular 
vegetables or ice-cream and recite the poem. You could think of a suitable rhythm for 
the poem. 
The section can begin with a discussion started by the teacher, in this case 
on environment and recycling of waste. This can be done with the help of a 
practical example of children making paper bags from old newspaper. These 
bags could be given to the neighbourhood provision store to be used instead of 
plastic bags. Remember, paper bags are environment friendly. Old newspapers 
can also be used to make envelopes of different sizes and masks for school 
plays. 
When we use several sentences to tell others about something that we have 
seen, read, heard or done, it is called a report. For the teacher, 
along with the children, should first go through the report on Uncle Lal's farm. The 
children can then do the guided report on ice creams available in their area or on 
food, toyshops, soaps, some animal, care of pets etc. 
A creative activity should be followed by a presentation before the entire class. 
The poems, recipes, the findings of any task etc. could be done as group

My Shadow

I have a little shadow that goes 
in and out with me. 
And what can be the use of him is 
more than I can see. 
He is very, very like me from the 
heels up to the head; 
And I see him jump before me, 

When I jump into my bed. 
..

The funniest thing about him is the way 
he likes to grow 
Not at all like proper children, which is 
always very slow; 
For he sometimes shoots up taller like an 
India-rubber ball, 
And he sometimes gets so little that 
There's none of him at all. 

One morning, very early, before the 
sun I was up, 
I rose and found the shining dew 
on every buttercup; 
But my lazy little shadow, like an 
arrant sleepyhead. 
Had stayed at home behind me and was 
Fast asleep in bed.

One day, when I was going towards my boat, I was 
surprised to see the footprint of a man on the sand. I 
stood amazed! I listened; I looked around me; I could 
neither hear nor see anything. I went up higher to look 
down; I went up the shore and down the shore, but it was 
no good; I could find no other footprint but that one. I 
went to it again to see if there were any more footprints 
and to tell if it had been my imagination. But I was not 
mistaken, for there was exactly the print of a foot — toes, 
heel, every part of a foot. I could not imagine 

how it came there. 


At last I returned home very frightened, looking behind 
me after every two or three steps, mistaking every bush 
and tree to be a man. 

When I came to my cave (which I called my castle), I 
ran inside it, as if I was being chased. I do not remember 
whether I used the ladder or went in by the hole in the 


....... 


..

rock, which I called the door. I ran for cover, faster than 
any animal could run. 

I did not sleep that night. The more I thought about 
what I had seen, the more afraid I became. I thought it 
could be one of the savages of the mainland who had 
wandered out to the sea, in a small boat. 

Luckily I was not on shore at that time, but what if he 
had seen my boat! If he had seen the boat he would have 
realised that someone lived on the island and would soon 
return with others to kill and eat me. 

And so I lay fearful for many days and prayed for 
protection. In doing so, I was much comforted and began 
going out to investigate. But even now as I went forward, I 
looked behind me frequently, because I was still 
very frightened. 

However, as I went about for two or three days and 
saw nothing I became a little bolder. I decided to go down 
to the shore again and examine the footprint once more. I 
decided to measure it with my own footmark. 

As I came closer to the footprint, I realised that it could 
not be my footprint because I had not come to this part of 
the beach since a long time. Secondly, as I placed my foot 
alongside that footprint, it seemed larger than my own. 

My fear returned! I went home again, believing that 
there was someone there. 

The island was inhabited! 

(Adapted from Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe)

A classroom library reading programme would provide for reading tastes, interests 
and abilities of all children. The teacher should ask the children to read the original 
story, Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe. They could also read other books on 
adventure, stories of family life, humour, mystery, animals stories and stories of 
people, and talk about what they have read. The exceptional qualities one finds in 
adventurers can be discussed in class. 
Take the children outdoors to see the shadows of trees and the school building. Help 
them understand the absence of shadows on a cloudy day. The teacher should 
explain the shortening and lengthening of shadows through the day. 
Since this unit is about our fears, the children could be asked to express some of their 
fears, also their unreasonable fears. They can discuss how best to deal with these 
fears. 
The two creative writing exercises have leading questions to guide the children. 
These exercises will stimulate their imagination. 
Find out how ships and planes are guided towards land? The children should 
consult the encyclopedia and share their answers with the class. To cultivate a 
taste for reading, one period a week can be devoted to using the library. Books 
appropriate to the age group can be chosen for individual reading. Children can 
be asked to write about the book they have read during the language class or 
share a story with their classmates.

SCENE 1 A hostel room. Two brothers, aged 9 and 14 years 
sitting at a study table. The elder brother, Bhaiya, 
is reading a book and the younger one, Munna, is 
drawing pictures of birds and animals. 

BHAIYA What are you doing, Munna? 

MUNNA I am drawing. 

BHAIYA When will you study? Where were you in the 
morning? 

MUNNA (turning pale) I was playing. Bhaiya, how can 
you sit with a book for hours together? 

BHAIYA That's because I want my foundation in 
education to be very strong. If the base is 
strong then the building will stand firmly. 
Sometimes it takes me two years to do one 
year's work. 

MUNNA Bhaiya, you are five years older than I am and 
three classes ahead of me. I wonder why you 
keep writing the same word twenty times, one 
sentence more than twenty times and copy 
poems several times in beautiful letters? 

BHAIYA You know, studying English is no child's play, 
one has to work very hard in order to learn the 
subject. To speak or write English properly, 
tremendous effort is required. But the moment 
you get a chance, you run to the field, play 
marbles and fly paper kites, or sit idling away 
with friends for fun! Can’t you sit down a

MUNNA Oh Bhaiya, there is a big mela in the village

BHAIYA Have you ever seen me going to a fair or going 
to watch a cricket or hockey match? I don't go 
near them. I prefer to study a book. I don't 
mind repeating a class for more than two 
years. But you might stay in the same class all 
your life. Do you expect to pass if you waste 
your time playing all the time? You are simply 
wasting father's hard earned money. 

(Munna starts crying on being scolded and 

sobbing sounds wah, wah, bah, bah, hu, hu, 

are heard) 

MUNNA Bhaiya, I feel like running away and going 
back home. 

BHAIYA Now, now! Stop crying. Put on a nice smile. 
Look I will make a timetable for you to follow. 
Get up at dawn.

MUNNA But when is the time to play? 

BHAIYA Play? What is the need, Munna? 

MUNNA Oh! I love the green fields, the gentle breeze, I 
want to jump up like a football, I like the touch 
and go and hu tu tu sounds of the kabaddi, and 
the hurry and flurry of volleyball pulls me like 
a magnet. As soon as I am on the field, I forget 
everything. 

SCENE 2 The final exams are over and the results are out. 

BHAIYA Alas! I have failed once again. 

MUNNA Oh! But Bhaiya, I have passed and topped my 
class. Now there is only two years difference 
between us. 

BHAIYA But my dear brother, don't be so proud. 
You have passed only one class and you think 
that I'm stupid and you are smart. Once in a 
while, in a gulidanda game, you might get 
lucky and hit a goal but that does not mean

Now, what would you do if I were to fall sick

MUNNA I don't know, Bhaiya! I would tell Baba and he 
would rush to the hostel. 

BHAIYA Aha! I had expected this answer. Now Baba 
would not get upset. He would first try to find 
out what was wrong and then he would call a 
doctor. Baba would know exactly what to do. 
They have more experience than us.

you say is true.

Respecting elders and their experience 
Looking at the lighter side of life 
Teachers should encourage children to read classics in English as well as in any 
other languages they know, to enhance their reading habit. 
It is also important for children to understand that all poems need not rhyme. There 
are also poems that are in blank verse though there is a basic rhythm to such poems. 
This Unit presents a story of Premchand translated into English, setting forth 
translation as a means of understanding other cultures. 
The teacher should view children's talk as a valuable resource. Conversing in small 
groups can nurture the abilities to compare and contrast, to wonder and remember, 
to guess and challenge, to judge and evaluate. 
Children can be asked to enact different emotions like joy, anger, excitement,

Looking at the lighter side of life 
Teachers should encourage children to read classics in English as well as in any 
other languages they know, to enhance their reading habit. 
It is also important for children to understand that all poems need not rhyme. There 
are also poems that are in blank verse though there is a basic rhythm to such poems. 
This Unit presents a story of Premchand translated into English, setting forth 
translation as a means of understanding other cultures. 
The teacher should view children's talk as a valuable resource. Conversing in small 
groups can nurture the abilities to compare and contrast, to wonder and remember, 
to guess and challenge, to judge and evaluate. 
Children can be asked to enact different emotions like joy, anger, excitement, 
sadness etc.

Fred is a very lazy frog 
Who lolls all day upon a log. 
He always manages to shirk 
Doing a single stroke of work. 

His poor old mother calls in vain 
“Come in and help!” he does not bother 
To move two inches, much preferring 
To be extremely hard-of-hearing. 
He lies there in a silent heap, 
And stays conveniently asleep. 
If a lady frog hops past 
You’d think he would get up at last 
To bow, and help her on her way? 
But no, I am ashamed to say 
That when a lady frog comes by 
He does not open up one eye!

Many years ago, at the foothills of the Kaatskill (Kat-skill) 
mountains, was a little village. In the village lived a 
simple, good-natured fellow named Rip Van Winkle. He 
was a kind neighbour, ready to help anyone. Everyone in 
the village liked him. The children of the village shouted 
with joy whenever they saw him because he played with 
them, he taught them to fly kites and shoot marbles, and 
told them long stories. 

The only problem with Rip was that he was very lazy. 
He did no work on his own farm and just idled away his 
time. His fences were falling to pieces. His cow was going 
astray. Weeds grew on his farm. Rip's constant 
companion was his dog, named Wolf. To avoid work, he 
would walk away into the forest with his dog. 

One day, Rip just walked on and on and reached the 
highest part of the mountains. It was late in the 
afternoon when he reached there. Tired after his long 

climb, he lay down and began daydreaming. It was soon 
evening and he realised it would be night by the time he

reached his village. 
Suddenly, he heard a voice calling out, “Rip Van 
Winkle, Rip Van Winkle!” He looked around and saw a 
reached his village. 
Suddenly, he heard a voice calling out, “Rip Van 
Winkle, Rip Van Winkle!” He looked around and saw a 
short, old man, with thick hair and a grizzled beard 
walking towards him with a barrel. He made signs to help 
him carry the barrel. Rip hurried 
to help the stranger who caught 
his hand tightly. Together they 
reached a place where there 
were some more odd looking 

men, playing ninepins. 
They were all dressed the 
same way and all of them 
had beards of various 
shapes and colours. Even

though they were playing a game, 
serious and there was silence! The only sound was the 
noise of the balls, which echoed in the mountains like 
their faces were 

thunder. 
As Rip and his companion reached them, they 

stopped playing and stared at Rip with a fixed gaze. Rip 
was really frightened. His companion emptied the 
contents of the barrel into glasses and made Rip drink it. 
Rip obeyed as he was trembling with fear. Since he was 
thirsty he drank a few more glasses and slowly fell into a 
deep sleep. 
On waking up, he found that he was at the place 
where he had first met the old man. He rubbed his eyes — 
it was a bright sunny morning. “Surely, I have not slept 
here all night,” thought Rip. 
He looked around for Wolf, but he was nowhere. Rip 
whistled for him. “Wolf! Wolf!” he then shouted. No dog 
was to be seen. “Where has this dog gone?” he

tered to himself. He began to descend the mountain to go 
back to his village. 
As he neared the village, he met a number of people 
but he didn't know any of them. The villagers also stared 
at him equally surprised. “Who is this man?” said one. 

“I've never seen him before,” said another, “look at his 
long white beard and his wrinkled face.” 

On hearing this, Rip stroked his chin and, to his 
astonishment, he found his beard had grown a foot long, 
and it was all white! 

An old woman walked up to him and looked at his face 
for a moment. Then she exclaimed — “It is Rip Van 
Winkle! Welcome home again, old neighbour! Where have 
you been these twenty long years?

|.............................. 


In the city of Cashgar, lived a barber who was a great 
talker. Once the Sultan called the barber to shave 
his head. The barber started talking non-stop 
instead of shaving him. The Sultan got angry. 

“When are you going to stop talking and begin to 
do your work?” 

The Barber replied, “You do me an injury by 
calling me a chatterer. For, everyone says I am very 
quiet. I have six brothers whom you might call 
chatterers. Their names are Bacbone (buk-bon), 
Bakbarea (buk-buria), Bakbac (buk-buk), Alcouz 
(ul-kooz), Alnaschee (ul-nashi) and Schacabac( shaka-
bak). One is humpbacked, one is toothless, one 
is half blind, one is quite blind, one is deaf and the 
other has a defect in his speech and they are all 
great talkers, but I am the youngest of my family,

“Give him three pieces 
of gold,” the Sultan cried, 
losing all patience, “and send 
him away. I will not be 
shaved today.” 

“My Master,” cried the 
Barber, “it was not I who 
came to seek you, it was 
you who ordered me to 
come. So I will not quit 
your house till I have 
shaved you.” 

He then began narrating another 
story, which lasted half an hour. 

“Stop making your fine speeches and let me go 
quickly. I have an affair of the greatest importance. I have 
...
to go out at noon,” said the Sultan. 

....... 



When he saw that the Sultan was really angry with 
him, the Barber said, “O Master, do not be angry, I will 
begin to shave you.” Saying this, he washed the Sultan’s 
head and began to shave. But he had not touched him 
even four times with the razor, when he stopped and 
said, “My Master, you are acting hastily in this matter.” 

“Go on shaving me, speak no more”, ordered the 
Sultan. 

“Be patient,” said the barber, “perhaps you have not 
considered well what you were going to do. I wish you 
would tell me what this matter of great importance is all 
about and then I will give you my opinion on it.” 

“Finish shaving at once,” the Sultan exclaimed. But, 
instead of doing this, the Barber left the Sultan half-
shaved to go and see what time it was.“ My patience is 
exhausted,” the Sultan cried. 

“Be calm, my Master and you shall be shaved in a 
moment,” said the Barber and saying this, he continued 
shaving the Sultan. But while he was doing this, he could 
not help talking. 

“If you could inform me what this important affair is, I 

advice which you might find useful,” he 

letely fed up by now and decided

of the Barber, was ready to do anything to be rid of him. 

“Be quick and finish your work,” the Sultan replied, 
“and you shall have all the food that has been prepared 
for me today.” 

“Please show me the food so that I may judge if it is 
enough for my five friends.” 

“I have enough food for you!” the Sultan exclaimed. 
But he ordered that all the food prepared for his feast be 
brought in. 

The Barber looked over the food and said “This is very 
good but I shall want some fruit for the dessert also.” 
The Sultan, in desperation, since his head was half 
shaved, ordered that the fruits should also be brought in.

Awareness about different kinds of personalities — talkers, quiet people

The use of a dictionary while doing all the vocabulary exercises should be encouraged 
to help students gain confidence when they come across new, challenging words. The 
teacher can ask the children to read stories from The Arabian Nights and other witty 
and humorous stories, e.g. Tenali Raman, Akbar-Birbal etc. 
Ask the children to talk about wit and humour and understand their importance in 
life. The teacher should explain that we must also learn to laugh at ourselves. 
Some people talk too much and do not realise what they are saying while others do 
not say a word. In both cases, the problem may be shyness. The teacher can help 
children gain self-confidence by carrying out group activities like singing, dancing, 
acting, sports, or a hobby like craft, painting etc. When the child discovers he is good 
at something, it shall boost his self-confidence. Remember, every child has 
something to say and has some insight to contribute to a class discussion. The 
teacher needs to recognise this and help the children gain confidence, and teach 
them to be courteous and civil. 
Before starting on the writing exercise, the teacher could do a guided writing piece, 
step-by-step, on the blackboard. 
What does being brave mean? 
Telling the truth, not being tempted to do naughty things, not hiding things 
from parents, being generous, all require children to be brave. Saving 
someone's life, catching thieves etc. are brave deeds. Both, being brave and 
doing brave deeds are creditable. It is not easy to be brave and children should 
be encouraged to be brave and courageous. 
The teacher can then discuss the Republic day parade, and the significance of 
little children like them being given Bravery Awards.

The people walk upon their heads, 
The sea is made of sand, 
The children go to school by night, 
In Topsy-turvy Land. 

The front-door step is at the back, 
You're walking when you stand, 
You wear your hat upon your feet, 
In Topsy-turvy Land. 

And buses on the sea you'll meet, 
While pleasure boats are planned, 
To travel up and down the streets 
Of Topsy-turvy Land. 

You pay for what you never get, 
I think it must be grand, 
For when you go you're coming back, 
In Topsy-turvy Land.

G ulliver's Travels 
On the 16th of June 1730 we discovered land. Our 
captain sent a dozen men with vessels for water, if any 
could be found. When we came to land we saw no river or 
spring nor any inhabitants. I went on to explore. The 
country was barren and rocky. I turned back to join the 
crew, only to see them getting into the boat and rowing 
for life to get to the ship. 

Before I could reach them I observed a huge creature 
walking after them in the sea as fast as he could. The 
water of the ocean reached only till his knees! However, 
the monster was unable to overtake the speeding boat. I 
turned back quickly and climbed up a steep hill with fields 
of barley on either side and the corn rising upto forty feet. 
There was a fence to pass from one field to the other. 
...

........ 



It was impossible for me to climb because every step 
was six feet high. I was trying to find a gap in the hedge 
when I discovered one of the inhabitants in the next field 
walking towards the fence. He was of the same size as the 
creature chasing the boat. I was struck with utmost 
fear and astonishment and ran to hide myself. He called 
in a voice much louder than a trumpet. It sounded like 
thunder! Seven monsters like him came towards the field 
ready to reap the corn. They 
ied a reaping hook 
hich was very big. 
When one of the reapers 
approached where I 
lay hidden I screamed 
as loud as I could. 
The creature 
stopped reaping, 
picked 
me up between 
his thumb and 
forefinger and brought

good look at me. I walked slowly backward and forward, 
pulled off my hat and made a low bow towards the farmers. I 
tried to speak to them loudly in several languages. Each time I 
did so the farmer who picked me up held his ear very close to 
me but in vain. The farmer took me to his house and placed 
me at some distance on the dining table which was thirty feet 
high from the floor. 

Dinner was brought for the farmer in a dish which was ten 
feet in diameter. The farmer's wife crumbled some bread and 
placed it before me. In the middle of the dinner I heard a noise 
behind me. It was the purring of a cat that was ten times larger 
than an ox. The farmer's wife was stroking him. Then 
entered the farmer's one year-old son in the arms 
of a lady. On seeing me the child grabbed me 
from the table and put my head into his 
mouth. I shouted so loudly that the baby 
dropped me. I would have broken my 
neck if the mother had not held her 
apron under me. Later she put me on 
her own bed and covered me with a 

clean white handkerchief.

Once a lion lay fast asleep in the Ranathambore forest of

One mouse got trapped under the lion’s paw. The lion woke 
up, laughed loudly and let the mouse go! 

After some days the mouse heard the lion’s roar. He saw that 
the lion lay in great pain as he was tied with many ropes. The 
mouse used his sharp teeth and cut the rope. 

‘‘You are a true friend,’’ said the lion.

T he L ittle Bully 
Once upon a time, not so very long ago, there was a small 

boy called Hari. Although he 

wasn’t very big, he was 

strong, and he loved to 

tease all the boys and girls 

who went to school with 

him. What he loved to do 

most was to pinch. He could 

make a big bruise appear in 

half a second. Another trick 

he played was pricking 

people with a pin. 
So you can guess how all 

the children hated him. The 

tried pinching him back, 

that was no good because he could 

always pinch harder. They didn't like telling their 

teacher, because that was telling tales. 

It so happened that the class went for a picnic to 

the seaside for a whole day. All the children were 

most excited. 


........ 


...

On that day, the sun shone bright, and all the 
children were wild with excitement. They crowded into 
the train and sat down — but nobody wanted to sit next 

to Hari because he always pinched. 
When they arrived at the seaside, out jumped all the 
children with a shout of joy. Down to the sands they 
raced, hand in hand — but nobody took Hari’s hand. 
Nobody went near him. 

Hari was angry. He went to a sandy corner near a 
rocky pool and sat down by himself. He took out his 
lunch and looked at it. It was a good lunch. There were 
two hard-boiled eggs, six jam sandwiches, three pieces of 
bread and butter, a ginger cake, and a bar of chocolate. 
He would eat it all by himself. He wouldn't offer anything 

anyone! 
...

....... 



Just as he was beginning on the eggs, he heard a 
hoarse voice near him. “Good morning! I am so pleased to 
meet a boy like you.” Hari turned around and stared in 
fright. Whatever do you think he saw? 

Hari saw a monster crab walking sideways out of the 
pool. His eyes were on the ends of short stalks and he 
looked most queer. He held out his 
front claw to Hari. Hari put out 
his hand to shake the crab’s 
claw, but to his surprise 
and anger the crab 
opened his pincers 
and nipped his 
hand so hard that 

the little boy yelled. 

“Ah, here is my good cousin,” said the crab pleasantly, 
and, to Hari’s horror, he saw a large sandy lobster 
crawling heavily out of the pool. Before the little boy 
could stop him the lobster took his hand in his great 
pincer-like claws and pinched it so hard that Hari yelled

in pain. 

Then he stared at the pool in surprise, for, out came 
sandy-coloured shrimps and prawns, more crabs, and 
another large lobster and they pricked Hari till he was 
soon black and blue with their pinching. 

“Don’t you like it?” said all the creatures in surprise. 
“Why, we were told you would love to see us because you 
were a champion pincher and pricker yourself. Come, 
come join in the fun!” 

Hari leapt to his feet, crying loudly. His lunch rolled 
into the pool, and when the crabs and lobsters saw it 
they ran to it and began to feast eagerly. Hari saw that 
they had forgotten him for a time, and he turned and ran 
for his life, tears streaming down his cheeks. 

“They only did to me what I keep doing to the 
other children,” he thought. “But how it hurt! And how I 
hated those crabs and lobsters! I suppose the other 

children hate me too. Well, I jolly well shan’t pinch or 
prick any more.”

T he Village C hild 

My home is a house 
Near a wood 
I'd live in a street 
If I could! 
I do wish someone 
Lived near. 
There's no one to play with 
At all. 
The trees are so high 
And so tall: 
And I should be lonely 
For hours, 
Were it not for the birds 
And the flowers. 

T he C ity C hild 

I live in a city 
In a street; 
It is crowded with traffic 
And feet; 
There are buses and motors 
And trams. 
I wish there were meadows 
And lambs. 
The houses all wait 
Inarow 
There is smoke everywhere 
That I go. 
I don't like the noises 
I hear 
I wish there were woods

Mr Phileas Fogg lays a bet with some of his friends to go 
around the world in 80 days. This is the story of how 
...
he travelled with his companion, Passepartout. 

........ 



That evening they were on the train from San 
Fransisco to New York, which was three 
thousand seven hundred and eighty six miles 
away. In seven days the train would take them 
from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean. 

The train steamed through California at 
full speed. It crossed steep mountain slopes, 
deep canyons and hair-raising curves moving 
through a few tunnels and bridges. 

Suddenly the train slowed down as a herd 
of buffaloes charged across the railway track. 
The train was forced to stop till the procession 
passed like a great brown river. The herd took 
a full three hours to cross the tracks. Night 
had fallen by the time the train could move 

. 




again. 

The train headed for the steep mountains. This was 
the most difficult part of the journey with its winding 
roads. They passed the highest point of their journey, 
7524 feet above sea level. In a few hours they would be 
out of the Rocky Mountains. 

After the passengers had taken their breakfast the 
train gave a shrill whistle and braked with a jerk and 
came to a halt. Passepartout, a French passenger went to 
see what the matter was. There was nothing to be seen. 
The train had halted in the middle of nowhere. There was 

....... 


...

no station in sight. 
He heard the signalman say, “The train can't go on. 
The bridge near Medicine Bow won't support the weight.” 
It was a suspension bridge and some of its cables were 
broken. 
The driver of the train said, “Perhaps there is a chance 
of getting across the bridge by letting the train proceed at 
maximum speed.” 
“All aboard,” said the conductor. The passengers got 
on the train and the driver reversed the train for nearly a 
mile. Then he gave another whistle. The train began to 
move forward so fast that it was frightening. The 
passengers had the feeling that the train was not resting 
on the tracks but was floating through air. As the engine 
shrieked and the train shuddered they were over the 
bridge in a flash! 
As soon as they passed over the Medicine River, the 
bridge crashed down into the raging waters below. The 
train continued its course that evening without 
interruption. 
As the train moved forward the next day, it was 
suddenly attacked by hundreds of Sioux Indians (a tribe 
of native Red Indians). Many of them appeared from all 
sides, jumped on to the moving train and pulled 
themselves up the steps. They were armed with rifles. 
Some of the travellers had revolvers. They defended 

....... 


...

themselves bravely by answering with pistol shots. 

The conductor cried out, “The train must be stopped 
or we are lost!” “I will go,” said Passepartout. He opened a 
door and unseen by the Red Indians he slipped under the 
racing train, and holding on to the chains he slowly 
reached the engine. Then he separated the engine from 
the coaches. They started to slow down. 

They had neared a station where soldiers, attracted by 
the sound of shots, hurried towards the train. The Red 
Indians on board saw them and quickly jumped off before 
the train stopped entirely.

Unit 10 Malu Bhalu 

|............
High up in an icy lair 

Lived a little polar bear 
Snow white, snow bright was her mane, 
Malu Bhalu was her name. 
Very soon our Malu Bhalu 
Learnt the things her parents knew. 
Fish to catch, big and small... 
Malu was a clever girl. 
Malu said to her mother one day: 
Ma, I’m going far out to play. 
I want to see the things that lie 
There beyond the big blue sky. 
A little patience, child, said Mum, 
In the summer when next it comes. 
Summer?... Patience?... What a test! 

........

Malu simply could not rest. 

First things first! Malu’s mum 
Clasped Malu tight within her arms. 
Then she said — her voice was firm 
Now my dear you’ll have to swim. 

But Ma! said Malu, what do I know? 
How will I? I’ve never swum before! 
Don’t worry dear, said Malu’s mother, 
Do as I do, that’s all, she advised her. 

She had no choice, no other way, 
Malu had to swim that day. 
Tight she gripped her mother’s hand, 
Into the water splash! to land. 

Brave mother’s brave young daughter! 
Doubt and fear she left behind her. 
Malu swam with all her might, 
It didn't matter wrong or right. 

But swimming came so naturally, 
Her mother knew this and all could see. 
Fearless was Malu, this she knew, 
Not just brave, but special too.

Who will be Ningthou? 
dearly by the people. 
The Ningthou and Leima, on their part, never stopped 
thinking about their meeyam, their people. “Our meeyam 
should be happy,” they said. 
The people were not the only ones who loved their 
Ningthou and Leima. The birds and animals too loved 
them. The Ningthou and Leima always said: “Everybody 
in Kangleipak should live in peace. Not only the people, 
but the birds, animals and trees.” 
Their beloved king and queen had three sons: 
Sanajaoba, Sanayaima and Sanatomba. 
Twelve years later, a daughter was born. She 
was named Sanatombi. She was a lovely 
child, soft and beautiful inside. She was 
loved by one and all. 
The years went by, and the children grew 
up well. And then one day, the Ningthou 
called all his ministers and said: “It is now 

...

time to decide the Tunggi Ningthou, the 
future king.” 

The ministers were shocked. “But O 
Ningthou, what is there to decide? 
Sanajaoba, your eldest son, will be our future 

king.” 
“Well,” the Ningthou replied. “That’s how it 
happened in the old days. The eldest son always 
became the king. But times have changed. So let 
us select a king who is most worthy of becoming a 
king.” 
“We will have a contest to select the future 
king,” the Leima said. And so, in the land of 
Kangleipak, there was a contest, a horse race. 
Whoever reached the khongnang, the banyan 
tree, first would be declared Tunggi Ningthou. 
But then, a strange thing happened. 
Sanajaoba, Sanayaima and Sanatomba all 
three of them finished the race together. They 
were expert riders and all three reached the 
finish line at the same time! 
There was great excitement. “Look at 
them!” the people shouted. “Shagol 
thauba nupa, such fine horsemen!” 
But one question remained: Who 
would be the Tunggi Ningthou? 
The Ningthou and Leima turned 

to their sons. The Ningthou 
said, “Sanajaoba, Sanayaima and 
Sanatomba, you have proved that you 
are fine horsemen. Do something 

....... 
...


different each one of you, so that we can decide who will 
be Tunggi Ningthou.” 

Suddenly, Sanajaoba mounted his horse and held his 
spear straight in front of him. He looked around. There 
was a hush among people. “What is Sanajaoba, the 
eldest, going to do? They thought to themselves. 

Sanajaoba then looked at the huge khongnang 
standing majestically in the distance. He pierced the tree 
and jumped his horse right through it! 

“Bravo! Bravo!” The people shouted. “Thouro! Thouro!” 
And then they fell silent. 

Now it was the turn of the second son, Sanayaima. 
What would he do? Sanayaima too looked at the 
khongnang as he mounted his horse. Then he too rode 
towards the tree, harder and harder. The people watched 
in silence, afraid even to breathe. When he was really 
close, he urged his horse to jump. Higher and higher the 
horse rose until horse and rider jumped clear over the 
huge tree and landed on the other side in a wonderful 
motion. 

The people breathed in relief and said in unison: 
“Phajei ! Phajei ! Wonderful ! Wonderful ! 

And now, it was the turn of the youngest son, 
Sanatomba. He, too, rode his horse towards the 
khongnang and, before anybody knew what was 
happening, uprooted it. Triumphantly he carried the tree 
to the Ningthou and Leima and laid it at their feet! 

Shouts of Thouro ! Thouro ! Phajei ! Phajei !” filled the 
mountains. 

The people grew restless. Why were the Ningthou and 
the Leima taking so long to make the announcement? 

....... 


...

They craned their necks to see what was happening. 
The Ningthou and Leima were watching Sanatombi, 
their five year-old daughter. She looked sad and lonely. 
She stared at the khongnang which lay dead by the 
throne. Birds flapped worriedly around, searching for 
their homes in the tree. Sanatombi walked up to the 
khongnang and whispered, “The khongnang is dead. It 
was hurt by the spear and now it is dead.” 
The people were all attention. The Ningthou stood up. 
He looked at the three boys. He looked at the little girl. He 
turned to the people. “If anybody is worthy of becoming 
the ruler,” he said, “it is little Sanatombi. It was she who 
told us to look at the soul of the 
khongnang. Sanatombi feels 

..

......
the pain of others. She feels the pain of the people, the 
animals, the birds, the trees.” 

”I declare Sanatombi the future Leima of Kangleipak,” 
the Ningthou said. A silence fell. Everyone turned to look 
at the little girl, their future queen. There she stood, all of 
five, like a small khongnang, with birds flying all around 
her. They sat on her shoulders and on her head. She held 
out her hands full of grain and the birds flapped about 
her, pecking at the food. 

“A Leima is one who doesn’t hurt anybody in the 
kingdom.”
