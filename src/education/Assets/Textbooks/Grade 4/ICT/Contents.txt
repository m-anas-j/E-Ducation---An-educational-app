Foreword 

Information and communication technology has brought profound changes to almost all aspects of 
our lives in recent years. It has transformed activities as basic as how we work, communicate with 
each other, treat illnesses, travel, shop and enjoy our leisure time. The pace of change shows no sign 
of slowing: indeed, the development of ICT and its applications to areas such as the integration of 
media, are continuing at even faster rates than heretofore. In a relatively short period of time, ICT 
skills have become as fundamental to living a full life as being able to read, write and compute. 

Ireland has been a leading player in the development of the ICT industry. We have been a leading 
exporter of ICT hardware and software, and many of the key businesses in the industry have 
important bases here. Like other countries, we have also recognised that if our young people are to 
live full lives in a world transformed by ICT, they need to have opportunities to acquire and develop 
ICT skills from an early age. Since the late 1990s, we have made considerable investments in ICT 
infrastructure in schools, and in training for teachers and other professionals. Until now, little 
national research evidence has been published on the impact that the new technologies have had 
on schools and especially on teaching and learning. This report examines the extent to which ICT 
has been used in schools at both primary and post-primary levels and, more importantly, assesses 
the impact that ICT has had on teaching and learning, including the ways in which ICT is used to 
support the learning of students with special educational needs. 

The evaluation shows that while much progress has been achieved in the roll-out of ICT in schools, 
considerable challenges remain. The report presents findings and recommendations that will be of 
interest to teachers, principals, school support services, curriculum developers and policy-makers. I 
hope that it will inform debate and policy decisions on how we can ensure that young people have 
the skills, knowledge and attitudes necessary to benefit from the opportunities presented by this 
powerful technology in the years ahead.

Executive summary 

An evaluation of the infrastructure, planning and use of information and communications 
technology in teaching and learning was conducted by the Inspectorate in primary and post-primary 
schools during the school year 2005/06. The objectives of the evaluation were: 

• to examine the extent to which ICT was used in primary and post-primary schools 
• to evaluate the impact of ICT on teaching and learning 
• to assess the ICT skills of students at selected points in the education system and to obtain their 

views on their experience of ICT in their schooling 
• to obtain the views of principals and teachers on their ICT skills and their opinions of the impact 
and future role of ICT in education 
• to make recommendations for policy development regarding ICT in schools. 

xiv 



Executive summary 
The evaluation methods comprised: 
• a national survey of primary (234) and post-primary (110) principals 

• a national survey of primary (1,162) and post-primary (800) teachers 

• case-study school evaluations by inspectors (32 primary schools, 20 post-primary schools) 

• observations during classroom inspections (77 primary schools) 

• observations during subject inspections (111 post-primary schools) 

• a follow-up on-line survey of teachers in case-study post-primary schools. 

Summary of main findings 

The findings and recommendations are summarised here and are elaborated in chapter 7. 

Infrastructure 

• The student-computer ratio (SCR) in Irish schools is 9.1:1 at primary level and 7:1 at post-primary 
level. Information available from the OECD suggests that countries that have taken the lead in 
the provision of ICT in schools are aiming for or achieving a SCR of 5:1. 

• In the main, schools make effective use of the grants provided by the DES for developing their 
ICT systems. However, schools generally spend considerably more on ICT than the sums made 
available through these grants schemes. 

• The lack of technical support and maintenance is a significant impediment to the development of 
ICT in schools. 

• At primary level, computer rooms are generally a feature of the larger schools. However, access 
by students to computers was found to be superior where the computers were located in the 
classrooms. At the post-primary level there is a greater permeation of computers in specialist 
rooms than in general classrooms. 

• Schools were found to use a limited range of ICT peripherals, mainly printers, scanners, and 
digital cameras. Digital projectors were found in post-primary schools. At primary level, interactive 
whiteboards were present in a small number of schools. 

• Schools that made dedicated computer facilities available to teachers reported that it led to the 
use of more high-quality and creative teaching resources in classrooms. 

xv 



ICT in Schools 
Planning 

• Responsibility for ICT in a school can lie with an ICT steering committee, the principal, the deputy 
principal, an ICT co-ordinator, or a combination of these personnel. Greater efficiency is achieved 
where a named person has responsibility for ICT within a school and where their role is clearly 
defined. 

• The majority (71%) of primary schools surveyed, but fewer than half (46%) of post-primary 
schools, were found to have a written ICT plan. These plans tend to concentrate more on 
infrastructural issues than on how ICT can be used to enhance teaching and learning. 

• Most schools (83% of primary schools, 87% of post-primary schools) were found to have an 
acceptable-use policy (AUP). This is a product of the requirements of the Schools Broadband 
Access Programme and the safety-awareness initiatives of the NCTE. It is also an indication of the 
seriousness that schools attach to the risks associated with the use of the internet. 

• The majority of teachers make some use of ICT in lesson planning and preparation. Newly 
qualified teachers are more likely to use ICT for this purpose than their more experienced 
colleagues. However, fewer teachers were found to plan for the use of ICT in teaching and 
learning. At the post-primary level, planning for the use of ICT in teaching varies between 
subjects. The programmes for Transition Year, LCVP and LCA specifically encourage planning for 
the use of ICT in teaching and learning. Teachers of these programmes regularly reported that 
their involvement also encouraged them to use ICT in their teaching with other class groups. 

• School principals and teachers identified the provision and maintenance of hardware in schools 
and the provision of professional development opportunities in ICT as being strategically 
important for the development of ICT in their school. Generic programmes of professional 
development, because of their wider appeal, were found to have a greater take-up among 
teachers than topic-specific programmes. 

Teaching and learning 

• Only 30% of primary teachers and 25% of post-primary teachers rated their ability as either 
“intermediate” or “advanced” with regard to using teaching and learning methods that are 
facilitated by ICT. Recently qualified teachers had a higher perception of their ICT skills than more 
experienced teachers. 

• At the primary level, the inspectors reported evidence of the use of ICT to facilitate teaching and 
learning in 59% of the classrooms visited. However, the inspectors observed ICT actually being 
used in only 22% of the lessons observed. Nearly a quarter of all inspections showed a 
competent or optimal level of performance in relation to the use of ICT in the classroom. 

xvi 



Executive summary 
• Where ICT is used in primary classrooms it predominates in core curricular areas, such as English 
and Mathematics, and in Social, Environmental and Scientific Education (SESE). 

• The evaluation found that many fifth-class students in primary schools do not have the 
competence to complete basic tasks on the computer. While most students reported being able 
to perform many of the most basic computer tasks, such as turning a computer on and off and 
opening or saving a file, more than 30% reported that they were not able to print a document or 
to go on the internet by themselves. Almost half (47%) reported not being able to create a 
document by themselves. The majority did not know how to create a presentation (72%), use a 
spreadsheet (86%), or send an attachment with an e-mail message (88%). Competence in the 
use of ICT is limited for the most part to basic ICT skills, centred on the use of word-processing. 

• Only 18% of the post-primary lessons observed by the inspectors involved an ICT-related activity. 
Students’ interaction with the technology was observed in only about a quarter of these 
instances. The most common ICT-related activity observed was the use of a data projector to 
make a presentation to a class group. Inspectors judged that effective integration of ICT in 
teaching and learning was occurring in approximately half of the lessons in which the use of ICT 
was observed (i.e. in approximately 11% of all lessons observed). 

• Dedicated ICT lessons at the post-primary level are more prevalent among first-year classes, and 
are provided less frequently as students progress towards the Junior Certificate. The majority of 
schools concentrate on providing students with such lessons in their Transition Year, in the LCVP, 
and in the LCA. 

• High levels of integration of ICT were found at the post-primary level in the science and applied 
science subjects and in subjects in the social studies I group.1 Subjects were also identified that 
rarely made use of ICT, the most notable being Irish. 

• The evaluation found that fifth-year students in post-primary schools had the confidence to 
perform many basic computer operations by themselves, for example saving, printing, deleting, 
opening and editing a document. However, it also found that they generally needed some 
assistance to perform more complicated tasks, such as moving files, copying files to external 
storage devices, and writing and sending e-mail. A relatively low proportion of these students 
reported being able to create a multimedia presentation. Students required most help with 
attaching a file to an e-mail message, constructing a web page, or dealing with computer viruses. 
While the post-primary inspectors generally commented positively on the students’ ICT work that 
they observed, they were also concerned that the tasks undertaken by the students were largely 
word-processing and presentation tasks.

ICT in Schools 
• ICT is widely used to facilitate the provision by schools of special education. Generally, ICT is used 
more frequently by members of the special-education team rather than by mainstream class 
teachers. The emphasis in students’ engagement with ICT in special-education settings is mainly 
on the support of literacy. 

Support for ICT 

• The level of awareness among teachers of the ICT advisory service is generally low, with fewer 
than half the respondents at both the primary and the post-primary level reporting an awareness 
of it. Awareness is higher, however, among ICT co-ordinators than among other teachers. 

• The use of the ICT advisory service is also low. At the primary level only 22% of all respondents 
reported having used the service, while at the post-primary level the corresponding figure was 
15%. 

Summary of key recommendations for policy-makers and policy 
advisors 

• The level of ICT infrastructure in schools needs to be improved. Specifically, Ireland should be 
working towards equipping not just all schools but all classrooms with an appropriate level of ICT 
infrastructure. Consideration should be given to equipping all classrooms with a computer for use 
by the teacher, broadband internet access with adequate bandwidth, and a fixed data projector 
and screen for use by the teacher in presentations. Furthermore, to ensure appropriate access to 
ICT by students, Ireland should strive to reduce its student-computer ratio (SCR) from the present 

9.1:1 in primary schools and 7:1 in post-primary schools. International evidence suggests that 
countries that have taken a lead in this area are aiming for or achieving a ratio of 5:1 or less in all 
schools. 
• Improvements in ICT infrastructure will need to be supported by the introduction of a national 
ICT technical support and maintenance system for schools. Schools also need to be provided with 
the capacity to regularly upgrade their own ICT infrastructure. 

• The pedagogical dimension of the ICT advisors’ role in an education centre could be more 
appropriately provided by the relevant school support services, in liaison with the ICT school coordinators. 
The technical dimension of the ICT advisors’ role could be provided in a number of 
ways, including for example, by having a commercially supplied ICT maintenance and support for 
schools. With an effective IT maintenance system in place, the pedagogical role of ICT coordinators 
within schools could be enhanced and supported with appropriate training.

Executive summary 
• Support services should give priority to the integration of ICT in teaching and learning. There is 
an opportunity for such services to work more closely with schools, and with school ICT coordinators 
in particular, to determine staff training needs and assist in organising appropriate 
professional development courses for teachers. Support service personnel should aim to be 
proactive in providing examples of how ICT can be used to facilitate teaching and learning in any 
programmes provided. Furthermore, course organisers should take greater account of the wide 
range of ICT abilities and experiences commonly found in groups of teachers and should provide 
differentiated ICT learning experiences for course participants. 

• Additional guidance should be provided to schools and teachers of students with special 
educational needs so that the needs of learners may be matched more appropriately with the 
technology available. 

• There needs to be an increased emphasis on the application of ICT in teaching and learning in 
teacher education at pre-service, induction and continuing professional development stages. It is 
recommended that teacher education departments in third-level colleges should provide student 
teachers with the skills necessary to effectively use ICT in teaching and foster in them a culture of 
using ICT in their work. Consideration should also be given to extending and expanding 
significantly the current range of professional development courses available for teachers. A 
major focus of such an initiative should be on how ICT may be integrated fully in the teaching 
and learning of specific subjects and curricular areas. The ICT Framework for Schools, which the 
NCCA will issue in the near future, will be a further assistance to schools in this regard. 

Key recommendations for schools 

• Schools and teachers should regularly review the use of ICT in their work. In particular, they 
should strive to ensure greater integration of ICT within teaching and learning activities in 
classrooms and other settings. 

• Teachers should exploit the potential of ICT to develop as wide a range of students’ skills as 
possible, including the higher-order skills of problem-solving, synthesis, analysis, and evaluation. 

• Principals should encourage and facilitate suitable ICT training for teachers. Schools should liase 
with relevant support services and should endeavour to establish mechanisms to facilitate the 
sharing of good practice among members of the staff. 

• Schools should endeavour to provide all their students with an appropriate and equitable level of 
experience of ICT at all class levels: at the primary level and at both junior and senior cycle at the 
post-primary level.

ICT in Schools 
• Schools should plan for the maintenance and upgrading of their ICT systems. 

• Computer rooms, where they exist, should be used to maximum effect. Staff members and 
students should be provided with adequate access to the internet. Post-primary schools in 
particular should aim to increase the permeation of ICT in general classrooms. 

• A designated staff member should be responsible for ICT development. An ICT plan should be 
developed, using a consultative process, and an appropriate-use policy (AUP) should also be 
established. 

• Teachers should endeavour to integrate ICT more in their planning and preparation for teaching. 

• Schools need to ensure that ICT is used to support students with special educational needs in the 
most effective and appropriate way. Schools need to ensure that they match students' needs to 
the most appropriate technology available, and that ICT is used to support not only the 
acquisition of literacy but the widest range of students' needs. 

• Schools should exploit the benefits to be had from ICT in their assessment procedures and also in 
their administrative practices.
