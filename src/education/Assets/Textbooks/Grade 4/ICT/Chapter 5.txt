5.1 Introduction 
This chapter deals with ICT and its contribution to teaching and learning in primary schools. It 
examines how familiar teachers are with the relevant technology and its applications by looking at 
their ICT qualifications and skills. The chapter then reviews the use of ICT in both mainstream and 
special-education settings and its use in assessment, drawing on information collated from 127 
classroom observations made by inspectors during WSE inspections, national questionnaire returns 
made by principals, teachers and students, and inspectors’ reports on thirty-two case-study schools. 

The chapter continues by examining the nature of the impact that ICT has on teaching and learning 
in the classroom. In this regard the views of inspectors, principals, teachers and students are all 
explored. Finally, the chapter draws attention to factors that were found by the evaluation to 
contribute to the successful integration of ICT in classrooms, as well as those that tend to constrain 
its development. 

5.2 Teachers’ ICT qualifications and skills 
The national survey of teachers showed that a relatively small proportion of primary teachers held a 
formal qualification in ICT. Approximately 4% of primary teachers had a postgraduate qualification 
in ICT in education, while a further 6% had other informal qualifications in ICT.51 The proportion of 
teachers with qualifications in ICT increased to 15% when other academic qualifications in ICT were 
included.52 The survey showed that 48% of all teachers studied a module in ICT as part of their pre-
service preparation. This proportion was higher for teachers under the age of thirty-five (81%) than 
for teachers over thirty-five (14%). It may be assumed that teachers who have no formal 
qualification will have developed their ICT skills through personal interest or by availing of relevant 
professional development courses. 

51 Informal qualifications refer to such courses as the European Computer Driving Licence (ECDL). 
52 Other academic qualifications in ICT might include a BSc in computer science.

Teachers were asked to state their perceived level of proficiency in a number of important ICT skills 
areas.53 An analysis of the responses to this question showed that the majority of teachers do not 
consider themselves proficient in a wide range of ICT skills and applications. In addition, the majority 
of teachers report their ability to use ICT-facilitated methods and to assess the potential of computer 
applications and the internet as low. The highest levels of proficiency were reported in word-
processing, the internet, and e-mail. Table 5.1 shows that more than 60% of all teachers rated their 
proficiency as “intermediate” or “advanced” in each of these areas. The lowest levels of proficiency 
were reported for networking, data-logging, assistive technology software, and programming or 
scripting. In general, proficiency correlated with age: younger teachers (under thirty-five) reported 
higher levels of ICT proficiency and use than their more experienced colleagues. This probably 
reflects a growing emphasis in teacher education on developing the ICT skills of student teachers, as 
well as the impact of an increasingly technological society. In the light of the importance of ICT in 
promoting a wider range of teaching and learning methods, including inquiry-based approaches, 
the education departments in third-level colleges should consider giving further priority to the 
inclusion of ICT in the preparation of students for teaching various aspects of the curriculum.

However, when teachers’ reported use of the relevant applications was correlated with their 
reported proficiency, as depicted in fig. 5.1, it was found that the level of proficiency was not 
reflected in actual use of the application. For example, the relatively low level of use of the internet 
and e-mail in classroom practice does not reflect teachers’ reported high levels of proficiency in their 
use. Hence it can be assumed that other factors, such as individual teachers’ motivation and access, 
influence the transfer of competence in individual applications to classroom practice.

When asked about their ability to use teaching and learning methods that are facilitated by ICT, 
30% of primary teachers felt they had “intermediate” or “advanced” ability. Table 5.2 also shows 
that approximately four out of ten teachers reported that they had “intermediate” or “advanced” 
ability to assess the potential of educational software (40% of teachers) or internet material (41% 
of teachers) to facilitate teaching and learning. Younger teachers and male teachers were more

positive in the assessment of their abilities in all three areas. The SCR ratio had a negligible effect on 
teachers’ self-assessment.

The analysis also shows that teachers’ competence is not of itself enough to ensure the transfer of 
that competence into practice. Obviously other factors, such as the availability of resources, 
teachers’ motivation, and the school culture, will affect actual use in teaching and learning. If ICT is 
to be effectively integrated in teaching and learning it is clear that a holistic approach, embracing 
awareness-raising, professional development (pre-service, induction and in-service), planning, and 
infrastructure, will be required. 

5.3 Classroom practice and ICT 
5.3.1 Planning 
Inspectors asked teachers during WSE inspections about their planning for the use ICT in their 
teaching. Some 43% of mainstream teachers, as shown in fig. 5.2, reported that their planning 
showed how they intended to use ICT in their teaching. 

111

No 57% Yes 43% 
Base: All mainstream class teachers (n = 127) 

Of those teachers who showed how they intended to use ICT in their teaching, the main planning 
emphasis was on curricular areas (96%), followed by planning for the development of discrete ICT 
skills (74%), and the use of ICT to provide for students with special needs (56%). English was the 
most prominent curricular area for teachers who planned to use ICT in their teaching (94%), 
followed by Mathematics (64%). Teachers of senior classes were more likely than teachers of junior 
classes to plan for the use of ICT in the teaching of Science, History and Geography.54 Slightly more 
than three-quarters (76%) of all teachers stated that their planning was based on the school’s 
planning for ICT. 

5.3.2 Frequency of ICT use 
During their WSE inspections, inspectors distinguished between finding evidence of the use of ICT 
to facilitate teaching and learning in the classrooms visited and actual observation of the use of ICT 
during the inspection period.55 Table 5.3 shows that inspectors reported evidence of ICT being used 
to facilitate teaching and learning in 59% of the 127 classroom observations carried out as part of 
WSE inspections. However, in only 22% of instances did they observe ICT being used in the 
classroom during an inspection period of approximately two hours. The differences between the 
indirect evidence of the use of ICT and the inspectors’ first-hand observation of the use of ICT in 
teaching suggests that there is limited integration of ICT in the teaching and learning processes. 
Inspectors found evidence of higher levels of ICT use in senior classes (70% of classroom 
observations) than in junior classes (46% of classroom observations). This would suggest that the 
potential of ICT is not being fully realised in the critical early years of a child’s development. 

54 Junior classes: infants to second class (inclusive). Senior classes: third class to sixth class (inclusive). 

55 Examples of such evidence include samples of pupils’ work, displays of work involving ICT, and pupils’ responses to questions posed 
by the inspector or teacher.

5.3.3 Organisation of ICT use 
Inspectors who observed the actual use of ICT during inspection visits were asked to state how ICT 
activities were organised. It was found that the most frequently used organisational approach to the 
use of ICT in classrooms was one where the students used computers individually; this was followed 
by paired use and then whole-class use. Much of the individual ICT activity was organised in 
rotation. Similarly, respondents to the survey of teachers, as depicted in fig. 5.3, reported that the 
most frequently used approach was classroom activity in which individual students worked in 
rotation, followed by group activity and whole-class teaching in the classroom. In this instance, 46% 
of all primary mainstream and special class teachers reported that they organise the use of ICT in 
rotation at least once a week for individual students in the classroom.

ICT in Schools • Part 3 ICT and teaching and learning in schools 
It could be assumed that this predominant use of ICT with individual students has a relatively low 
impact, given the likelihood that each student would have access to ICT for relatively short periods. 
However, it is positive that both paired and group approaches, as well as whole-class approaches, 
are used. The findings of the evaluation also give an insight into how teachers organise the use of 
ICT in accordance with specific school factors, such as the level of resources available. Individual or 
paired activity in rotation reflects a sensible use of resources in situations where resources are 
confined to a stand-alone computer (or computers). In this regard it is important that classroom 
organisational matters be emphasised in support materials and courses for teachers so that they can 
exploit potential opportunities for using ICT within the classroom, regardless of the resources 
available. 

5.3.4 Focus of ICT use 
The evaluation found that ICT, where used, predominates in core curricular areas, such as English 
and Mathematics, and Social, Environmental and Scientific Education (SESE), but that even this use 
of ICT is relatively infrequent. The national survey of teachers, as shown in fig. 5.4, demonstrated 
that ICT was used most frequently to promote learning in English. However, only 39% of these 
teachers used ICT in their teaching of English at least once a week. This weekly use was high relative 
to that for Mathematics and SESE, which had a weekly use of 28% and 14%, respectively. 
Furthermore, the case-study evaluations suggest that the use of ICT in the teaching of English, 
Mathematics and SESE is mainly to support and reinforce aspects of these subjects already taught.

ICT and teaching and learning in primary schools Chapter 5 
Both teachers and inspectors reported limited use, if any, of ICT in the teaching of other curricular 
areas. The low level of use in the teaching of Irish relative to the other core subjects is particularly 
disappointing given the potential of ICT as a tool in enhancing students’ motivation to learn the 
language. 

Teachers were asked in their national survey how frequently they used ICT to develop certain skills in 
their students. Fig. 5.5 shows that ICT is most frequently used to develop numeracy, reading and 
writing skills and less frequently to develop other important cross-curricular skills, such as research, 
presentation, social, problem-solving and communication skills. The use of ICT in developing 
reading, numeracy and writing skills, however, was infrequent, with fewer than 30% of teachers 
reporting using ICT at least once a week to develop these skills.

In the course of WSE inspections, however, inspectors noted the prominent use of ICT to support 
the teaching of reading and writing. Furthermore, the case-study school evaluations showed that 
the use of ICT in reading and numeracy was mainly for the purpose of consolidating learning, and 
that the use of ICT for the teaching of writing was generally limited to presenting personal writing 
and writing for projects, with little emphasis on the writing process. The case-study evaluations 
showed that the development of research skills was conducted mainly in the context of SESE and 
looking-and-responding activities in the Visual Arts, while the use of ICT to develop discrete skills 
was concentrated on word-processing and typing skills. 

115 



ICT in Schools • Part 3 ICT and teaching and learning in schools 
The evaluation showed a degree of correlation between a school’s SCR and the range of skills 
taught. An analysis of inspectors’ observations during classroom inspections, for example, found 
that schools with a low SCR were more likely to teach presentation, social, team and collaborative 
skills or communication skills than schools with a high SCR. The use of ICT to develop numeracy and 
reading skills was more prevalent in these schools. Similarly, the survey of teachers found that those 
in schools with a low SCR were more likely to use ICT to develop most skills. In the questionnaires 
for students a slightly higher proportion of those in schools with a low SCR said that they learnt 
more about computers at school than those in schools with a high SCR. 

The evaluation found a degree of progression in the development of ICT skills from junior to senior 
classes. Inspectors’ observations during WSE inspection visits showed that ICT was used more 
prominently to develop writing skills and referencing, research and investigation skills in senior 
classes and to develop reading skills in junior classes. The survey of teachers similarly showed that 
teachers of senior classes were more likely to use ICT for writing purposes and referencing, research 
or investigation skills, while teachers of junior classes were more likely to use ICT to develop reading 
skills. A range of inspectors’ reports on case-study schools showed a similar progression. 

It is clear from this examination that the use of ICT is somewhat limited in primary schools, and that 
the potential for using ICT to develop critical life skills, such as communication, problem-solving and 
independent working skills, is not being realised. Evaluations of the implementation of the primary 
curriculum in recent years have also drawn attention to the deficit of provision in relation to the 
development of higher-order skills. The narrowness of the range of skills developed, particularly in 
the junior classes, is of concern, given that this is a critical time in a child’s development. It is 
important that these students should have the same opportunity as those in senior classes to 
develop their presentation, research and higher-order skills through the use of ICT. There is a great 
need, therefore, to promote the development of these skills through ICT with regard to the 
implementation of the curriculum. The “Framework for ICT in Curriculum and Assessment” at 
present being developed by the NCCA will provide schools with advice in this area. 

5.3.5 Use of resources and applications in the classroom 
Software 

The national survey of teachers explored the extent to which software was used to facilitate 
teaching and learning. In general, as shown in table 5.4, some 86% of teachers used software to 
facilitate teaching and learning. Teachers of senior classes were slightly more likely to use software 
to facilitate teaching and learning (90%) than teachers of junior classes (83%). A lower SCR tended 
to have a positive impact on the use of software to facilitate teaching and learning, with 89% of 
teachers in schools with a low SCR reporting such use, compared with 83% of those in schools with 
a high SCR. It was also found that the three most common sources of advice regarding the selection 
of applications for particular curriculum areas were colleagues (85%), educational software suppliers 
(52%), and the ICT advisor (29%).

Case-study school evaluation reports emphasised the importance of software in facilitating the use 
of ICT in schools. A number of reports, for example, made explicit links between the availability of 
software and the extent to which ICT was used in a given school. The inspectors found widespread 
use of software resources in literacy and numeracy; however, they found that this was limited for 
the most part to consolidation (that is, reinforcing number facts and phonic skills), especially in 
junior classes and in the special-education setting. Apart from the use of software in SESE, case-
study school evaluations found a dearth of software in use for other aspects of the curriculum. 

Teachers of mainstream and special classes were asked in their survey to state which applications 
they used in their teaching in different curricular areas. Table 5.5 shows that the use of software 
predominated in the subject areas where ICT is used most frequently (that is, English, Mathematics, 
SESE, and the Visual Arts). The reliance on word-processing and the internet for other subjects, such 
as Irish, could be due to the relative lack of software available to support the use of ICT in those 
curricular areas, in contrast to that available for the other core areas.

ICT in Schools • Part 3 ICT and teaching and learning in schools 
Given the importance of software in facilitating the integration of ICT throughout the curriculum, 
there is a need to make primary teachers aware of the range of materials available in all curricular 
areas. It is also important that teachers are able to assess the potential of computer applications for 
use in their classrooms; developing this ability should be a central consideration in ICT training 
opportunities. As recommended by inspectors in the case-study school evaluations, schools should 
consider drawing up an inventory of computer applications in accordance with their suitability for 
class levels. Teachers also need to become more aware of the potential of other ICT applications, to 
become more competent in their use, and to engage in planning for their use in order that they can 
more fully integrate ICT in the teaching of the curriculum. 

The internet 

The survey of teachers asked them about their use of internet resources in planning and preparation 
for teaching and the use of the internet in classroom practice. As already seen in table 5.4, the 
internet was reported to be used as a resource in planning and preparation for teaching by 69% of 
all teachers. It was also found that such use was related to teaching experience, with recently 
qualified teachers being more likely to use internet resources in planning and preparation for 
teaching than their more experienced colleagues. 

However, teachers’ reported use of the internet in classroom practice was much lower than its use for 
planning and preparation. Only 24% of all teachers reported using the internet in classroom practice. 
The main reason for this difference was lack of internet access in the classroom, as cited by 58% of 
teachers. Presumably teachers have access to the internet outside school for the purposes of planning 
and preparation, while access within school is still somewhat limited. Other reasons reported by 
teachers for not using the internet in their classroom practice were lack of time (9%), lack of 
knowledge (9%), lack of computers (8%), and lack of suitability for children of this age (8%). 

Teachers of senior classes were more likely to use the internet in classroom practice (37%) than 
teachers of junior classes (15%). A low SCR had a slightly positive impact on the use of the internet 
to facilitate teaching and learning: some 28% of teachers in schools with a low SCR reported using 
the internet in their classroom practice, compared with 20% of teachers in schools with a high SCR. 

Those teachers who stated that they used the internet in their classroom practice (24% of all 
teachers) were also asked how frequently they used various internet resources. Fig. 5.6 shows the 
findings with regard to the use of internet resources in descending order of frequency of use.56

Of the teachers who used the internet in classroom practice, the most frequently used internet 
resources were teaching resources, educational news, information on current events, and e-mail. 
More than a third (35%) of all teachers using the internet used it at least once a week to obtain 
access to teaching resources. 

In their visits to the thirty-two case-study schools inspectors found that teachers made very limited 
use, if any, of the internet in their classrooms. In many of these instances there was an expectation 
that the installation of broadband would greatly facilitate the use of the internet as a teaching and 
learning tool. Where the internet was used, activities included carrying out research activities (for 
example project work in SESE and Visual Arts) through the use of search engines and educational 
sites. One school used e-pal web sites for the development of students’ communication skills. In 
another school, students had used interactive web sites in support of their science programme.

It is clear that the use of the internet by teachers in the classroom is limited (for the most part 
because of a lack of infrastructure), despite the fact that teachers themselves appear familiar with 
internet use, particularly in planning and obtaining access to resources and ideas for teaching. 
However, the practices observed in case-study schools, though engaged in on a limited scale, 
illustrate the potential for use of the internet in the classroom for developing such abilities as 
communication skills. Recent assistance to schools from the Department of Education and Science 
with regard to enhancing connectivity in schools should help to facilitate teachers in realising the 
potential of the internet. 

Peripherals 

Chapter 3 has already shown that there is little general use of peripherals, apart from printers, in 
primary classrooms. This is a cause of concern, given the role that the effective use of peripherals 
can play in the integration of ICT in teaching and learning, and the additional potential for their 
effective use in tandem with other ICT resources. For example, one inspector in a case-study school 
commented favourably on integrated ICT activity involving internet research, recording with a digital 
camera during field trips, and presenting findings using presentation software. Other inspectors 
commented favourably on the use of digital video recorders for the production of films. 

It is clear that teachers need to be made more aware of the potential of software, the internet and 
peripheral resources and to become more confident in their use. This may be addressed in more 
focused ICT planning and enhanced training opportunities. 

5.3.6 Quality of provision 
The national survey of principals explored their views on how existing use of ICT in their school was 
benefiting teaching and learning. The comments of principals were mainly positive. They expressed 
the view that ICT is useful for motivating students, for consolidating their learning, for improving 
how they present their work, and for presenting an additional challenge. They also suggested that 
ICT motivates children, promotes imagination and creativity, and develops problem-solving skills. In 
general, 51% of the principals surveyed were of the view that using ICT contributed to improved 
ICT skills, while 34% felt that it contributed to improving class content and support of the 
curriculum. 

Teachers also expressed positive attitudes in relation to the impact of ICT on teaching and learning. 
In the course of interviews in the case-study schools, teachers suggested a number of factors as 
having a positive impact in the classroom. 

• The visual impact and interactive nature of ICT has a positive effect on students’ motivation and 
levels of interest. It enhances their confidence, particularly those with special educational needs, 
and it increases students’ enjoyment of learning. 

120 



ICT and teaching and learning in primary schools Chapter 5 ICT and teaching and learning in primary schools Chapter 5 
• ICT assists the development of good social skills in the classroom, the development of cooperation 
between students and teachers, and the promotion of peer tutoring in classrooms. 

• ICT facilitates the development of students’ recording and presentation skills, followed by 
independent and self-correcting skills and research and information retrieval skills. 

• ICT is important in reinforcing and consolidating skills and learning. 

However, while teachers, both at the principal and the classroom level, were generally quite positive 
about the role of ICT in teaching and learning in primary classrooms inspectors found that the 
undoubted potential of ICT was frequently unrealised. As noted earlier inspectors found relatively 
limited evidence of the integration of ICT in teaching and learning in the classroom, with, for 
example, the use of ICT in only 22% of classroom observations. 

121 



ICT in Schools • Part 3 ICT and teaching and learning in schools 
As well as frequency of use inspectors also reported on the quality of use of ICT in teaching and 
learning where it was observed during the inspection period in classrooms visited during WSEs. Fig. 

5.7 shows that 34% of inspectors’ reports on classroom observations reveal limited or inappropriate 
use, or no use, of ICT in teaching and learning. In 42% of instances the inspectors reported that 
there was scope for development, while in 24% of instances they reported a competent or optimal 
level of performance. The proportion of competent or optimal levels was higher for senior classes 
(30%) than for junior classes (15%).

Inspectors also provided some commentary in relation to their rating of the quality of use of ICT in 
teaching and learning in the classroom. These comments point to a reliance on software for ICT use, 
and show that such factors as lack of planning and preparation constrain the effective use of ICT in 
classrooms and the systematic development of curricular skills using ICT. Table 5.6 provides a sample 
of these comments.

Table 5.6: Inspectors’ comments on the quality of use of ICT observed in teaching and 
learning 

Rating (class) Inspector’s comment 
Very little use, or inappropriate 

Discussions with the teacher reveal that ICT is used incidentally and for very short periods. 
use, of ICT (junior classes) 

Two programs were used intermittently, which are designed to enhance the students’ 
literacy skills. The teacher uses the internet to research work occasionally. In general, the 
use of ICT in the classroom is incidental rather than being planned or systematic. 

Scope for development 

The work the children were doing during the course of the evaluation was not adequately 
(senior class) 

prepared, and they were simply transcribing from the screen. It is worth noting, however, 
that they did have the ability to operate the search engine to obtain access to information 
on the topic of their choice. 

Competent practice 

Students are somewhat familiar with the use of Powerpoint as a medium of presentation 
(senior class) 

but still need clear direction from the teacher and are clearly dependent on her to an extent 
in manipulating the computers in the room. The teacher uses Powerpoint in presentation. 
Optimal level of performance 

Software on Ancient Egyptians: excellent stimulation of students, clarification of 
(middle class) 

information and consolidation. ICT used in project work; also video and camcorder use. 

Inspectors who visited case-study schools gave additional insights into the quality and range of ICT 
activity in primary schools. Many commented favourably on the attitude, enthusiasm and 
confidence of fifth-class students in using ICT, citing, for example, good use of relevant internet sites 
and reference software, both for project work and incidental research. 

Other commendable practices observed by the inspectors in case-study schools included: 
• the use of ICT to facilitate the writing process of drafting and redrafting and students’ writing in 
a variety of genres 
• the use of ICT in higher-order activities, such as the development of students’ critical skills in 
looking and responding to art, the use of exploratory software to develop problem-solving skills 
and logic capabilities, and the use of spreadsheets 
• the use of ICT to develop creative skills, such as drawing and design, listening and responding, 

activity in music, and construction skills (through the use of robotics) 
• the use of the digital camera in producing group and class projects 
• the use of ICT in teaching Irish poetry 
• the use of ICT to create and to record musical compositions 
• the use of databases for the collation, examination and presentation of data 
• the use of computer-generated presentations by students to present their project work. 

123 



ICT in Schools • Part 3 ICT and teaching and learning in schools ICT in Schools • Part 3 ICT and teaching and learning in schools 
However, the inspectors found that the range of skills and knowledge displayed by students varied 
significantly among case-study schools, and that competence in the use of ICT was limited for the 
most part to basic ICT skills, centred on the use of word-processing for personal writing and project 
work. One inspector described this in the following terms: 

A number of students in senior classes have developed some competency in ICT skills relating to the use 
of word-processing and the internet. They have also used the computer in the writing process and have 
access to content-rich mathematics and reading software. Students enjoy opportunities to paint and draw 
using the computer. Students are enthusiastic and confident in their discussion in respect of this relatively 
simple use of ICT. 

Despite this emphasis on the development of basic ICT skills, the survey of fifth-class students 
showed, as illustrated in fig. 5.8, that many lack the competence to complete basic tasks on the 
computer. While most reported that they were able to perform many basic computer tasks, such as 
turning the computer on and off and opening or saving a file, more than 30% reported that they 
were not able to print a document or to go on the internet by themselves, while almost half (47%) 
reported not being able to create a document by themselves. The majority were unaware of how to 
create a presentation (72%), use a spreadsheet (86%), or send an attachment with an e-mail 
message (88%).

Interestingly, more than four out of five students (82%) in the case-study schools who completed 
questionnaires stated that using a computer helped them with their schoolwork. This was mainly 
through the use of the internet for projects. Only 39% reported that they used their home 
computer for homework. A higher proportion of girls (87%) than boys (77%) stated that using a 
computer helped them with their schoolwork; this was primarily through typing stories, poems, and 
essays. Similarly, slightly more girls (43%) than boys (36%) stated that a computer helped them with 
their homework, again primarily for typing poems, essays, and stories. 

In general, it can be said that limited use is at present made of ICT in teaching and learning in 
primary schools. However, despite the constraints that inhibit the greater use of the technology, 
there are examples of its effective use that could be extended and built on through taking such 
steps as sharing good practice within and between schools.

5.3.7 Provision for students with special educational needs by 
mainstream class teachers 
The evaluation found that the level of ICT used to assist students with special educational needs 
within mainstream classrooms is quite low, despite the fact that the great majority of classrooms 
have children who have access to additional support. As shown in fig. 5.9, 53% of teachers in the 
schools visited by inspectors during WSE classroom inspections reported that they used ICT to assist 
students with special educational needs. Of those who did, teaching and learning was primarily 
facilitated by a student working individually on a computer (64% of teachers). These teachers 
reported using programs and web sites to assist their students. Teachers of senior classes were more 
likely to use ICT to assist students with special educational needs in their class (63%) than teachers 
of junior classes (39%). Given the predominantly individualised nature of the ICT-related activity 
involved, this may be related to the greater ability of older students to work independently, 
compared with that of the younger students. 

Fig. 5.9: Level of ICT support for students with special educational needs in mainstream 
classrooms 

Do you use ICT to support students with special educational needs in class? 

No 47% Yes 53% 
Base: All mainstream class teachers (n = 127) 

However, in only 11% of classroom observations did the inspectors on WSE visits observe the use of 
ICT in mainstream classrooms to assist students with special educational needs. Similarly to what 
was reported by teachers, the inspectors observed that the use of ICT to assist students with special 
educational needs was highest for senior classes and was primarily organised individually. 

The low level of ICT use with students with special educational needs in mainstream classrooms 
shows that the potential of ICT to provide a differentiated curriculum for those students is not being 
realised. There is clearly a need for teachers to become more aware of how to use ICT to 
differentiate work for their students. It is also of note that where children with special educational 
needs are given the opportunity to engage in ICT-related activity it is primarily as individuals. The 
potential for embracing paired or group activity in this regard could be further explored. 

126 



ICT and teaching and learning in primary schools Chapter 5 
5.4 ICT in special education 
Over the past decade there has been a significant increase in the level of resources provided for 
students with special educational needs within mainstream primary schools. The evaluation 
attempted to gain an insight into the extent and quality of the use of ICT in special-needs 
education. This section of the report looks at the provision for children with special educational 
needs by members of the special-education support team.57 

5.4.1 Access to ICT 
Inspectors on WSE inspections explored the level of access that students had to ICT in the special-
education setting. Some 85% of the seventy-one members of special-education support teams 
interviewed in schools, as shown in fig. 5.10, stated that their students had access to ICT. Of those 
with access, 90% said that ICT activity took place in the special-education support setting. Half 
(50%) of all respondents said that teaching and learning using ICT was organised by individually 
working with students with special educational needs. Somewhat less than half (45%) of 
respondents said that a combination of individual and group or paired work was used.

support settings

context? 

No 15% 
Yes 85% 
Base: All special education team members (n = 71) 

5.4.2 Planning for the use of ICT 
Approximately 57% of the members of special-education teams interviewed by the inspectors on 
WSE visits, as illustrated in fig. 5.11, reported that their planning showed how they intended to use 
ICT in their teaching. Of those who displayed an intention to use ICT in their teaching, the main 
emphasis was on reading (92%), followed by numeracy (82%) and writing (56%). Some 60% of 
special-education support teachers who planned for the use of ICT in their teaching reported that 
this planning was based on the school’s planning for ICT. 

57 Members of the special-education support team include the resource teacher, learning-support teacher and resource teacher for 
Travellers. It should be noted that, in accordance with Circular 02/05, learning-support teachers and resource teachers are now 
referred to as learning-support and resource teachers (LSRTs).

5.4.3 Frequency of ICT use 
Inspectors were asked to distinguish between evidence of the use of ICT to facilitate teaching and 
learning in the classrooms visited and actual observation of ICT in teaching and learning during the 
inspection period.58 Fig. 5.12 shows that 63% of the inspectors reported that they saw evidence of 
the use of ICT to facilitate teaching and learning in these classrooms, while 42% observed ICT being 
used in teaching and learning during the inspection period. This use is much higher than the level of 
ICT use observed by inspectors to provide for mainstream students (24%) and students with special 
educational needs within mainstream classrooms (11%). Most ICT use by members of the special-
education team was through individual work with the student (69% of instances).

5.4.4 Focus of ICT use 
The extent to which members of special-education support teams were using ICT to facilitate 
teaching and learning in a number of priority areas was explored as part of the evaluation. The 
special-education support teachers who responded to the national survey reported, as shown in fig. 
5.13, that the main use of ICT in the special-education setting was for reading, numeracy, writing, 
and the development of motor sensory skills. Some 75% of these special-education teachers 
reported using ICT to develop reading skills at least once a week, which was far more frequent than 
that reported for writing skills (40%), motor sensory skills (46%), and numeracy skills (54%). The 
inspectors observing classroom practice during WSE inspections also found that the main skills being 
developed were (in declining order of frequency) reading, numeracy, and writing. 

The evaluation found that there is a greater general range of skills development in the special-
education support setting than in mainstream classrooms. While ICT is used much less frequently for 
the development of other skills, such as communication, referencing, presentation, and higher-order 
skills, the use of ICT for the development of these skills is still much more frequent than that 
reported for mainstream classrooms.59

ICT in Schools • Part 3 ICT and teaching and learning in schools 
In general, the relatively high frequency of use of ICT by members of the special-education support 
team to promote the development of literacy and numeracy is not surprising, given the priority 
attached to these core curricular skills in schools in this learning context. ICT facilitates a multi-
sensory approach to the teaching of essential skills through the use, for example, of data projectors, 
speakers, and interactive whiteboards, and this should be exploited in special-education settings 
wherever appropriate. 

5.4.5 Use of resources and applications 
The survey of teachers explored the degree to which different applications were used in the 
development of a range of special educational needs priority areas. Members of the special-
education support teams, as illustrated in table 5.7, were found to use applications most frequently 
for the development of reading and writing skills.60

60 Care should be taken when interpreting the percentages from this table, as sample sizes are low. Only 14 % of respondents were 
considered to be support teachers. 

130 



ICT and teaching and learning in primary schools Chapter 5 
Furthermore, table 5.8 reveals that those members of special-education support teams surveyed 
made prominent use of word-processing and content-rich software to facilitate teaching and 
learning in the different priority areas. 

Table 5.8: Most frequently used applications to promote the development of individual 
learning priority areas

However, this reliance on content-rich software and word-processing suggests that the full potential 
of ICT is not being realised in special-education support settings. Teachers should explore the 
possibility of making greater use of other applications such as exploratory, reference and assistive 
technology software with students with special educational needs 

5.4.6 Quality of provision 
Inspectors were asked to describe the quality of ICT in special-education support settings during 
WSE evaluations. Their observations on the quality of use of ICT in teaching and learning, as 
illustrated in fig. 5.14, show a range of quality in provision. A third of the observations reveal very 
little or inappropriate use, or no use, of ICT in the classroom. Another 38% of the observations 
reveal scope for development. Approximately 29% of the observations stated that there was a 
competent or optimal level of performance in the special-education setting. The proportion of 
observations rated “competent” or “optimal” was higher (36%) for schools with a high SCR. 

131

Inspectors’ ratings of the quality of use of ICT in teaching and learning in special-education support 
settings are comparable, for the most part, with ratings on the use of ICT in mainstream classes. 
However, as table 5.9 shows, slightly more special-education support settings were allocated a 
“competent” or “optimal” rating (29%, compared with 24%).

Inspectors also provided some comments on the quality of use of ICT in teaching and learning in the 
special-education support context in line with their ratings. These comments, a sample of which are 
provided in table 5.10, suggest that quality of provision is mainly constrained by lack of resources, 
lack of planning and timetabling, and lack of competence on the part of teachers. The accessibility 
of such resources as computer applications would appear to be an important factor influencing 
provision. Where competent practice was identified, the inspectors drew attention to the integration 
of ICT in learning and the learning benefits that accrue from ICT-related activity. 

132 



ICT and teaching and learning in primary schools Chapter 5 
Table 5.10: Sample of inspectors’ comments on the quality of ICT use in special-education 
support settings 

Rating Comment 
Very little use, or inappropriate There is potential for more frequent and structured use of ICT to support the development 
use, of ICT of students’ literacy and numeracy skill. While a laptop computer has been purchased to 
support the work of learning support, it was not available or in use in the classroom during 
the inspection period. It is mainly used to support teachers’ planning and preparation. 
Scope for development The activity noted took the form of games only. The work was done independently, with 
little verbal interaction between teacher and student to ascertain whether understanding 
was deepening. 
Competent practice Teacher has a broad range of software to support her work with individual students and 
groups of students in a learning-support role. Hardware and software positioned in a very 
easily accessed corner. 
Optimal level of performance Excellent work done, where ICT is an integral part of the teaching and learning that takes 
place. A wide range of software used, and the work done is very well integrated in all 
curricular areas. 

Inspectors’ reports on case-study schools suggest that there are some good practices in the use of 
ICT to support children with special educational needs, but that these are not widespread. For 
example, inspectors commented favourably on effective use of ICT to promote creative writing, the 
development of project skills, independent learning, social skills, and co-ordination or motor skills. 
The use of creative writing software was also reported as a useful means of managing the teaching 
of a range of abilities within a group. 

In general, it is clear that there are some good practices in ICT use to facilitate teaching and learning 
in special-education settings but that there is also significant room for development. 

5.5 Assessment 
While the evaluation found some evidence of administrative use of ICT by teachers during the 
assessment of students, it found limited evidence of teachers engaging in the assessment of ICT-
related activity and its impact on teaching and learning. More than two-fifths (42%) of teachers 
interviewed as part of classroom inspections during WSEs said that they used ICT to record students’ 
progress. Only 12% of respondents in the survey of teachers, however, reported that they had 
attempted to assess the impact of ICT on teaching and learning. Of the teachers who attempted to 
assess the impact of the use of ICT on teaching and learning in the class, 46% reported using 
observation, while 22% reported using an assessment test. An analysis of inspectors’ reports on 
case-study schools also illustrates the lack of attention to assessment of students’ progress in ICT-
related activity throughout the curriculum. 

133 



ICT in Schools • Part 3 ICT and teaching and learning in schools 
It is clear that very little assessment of ICT-related activity takes place in primary school classrooms, 
which is critical, given that assessment, followed by planning, is the starting-point for improving the 
use of ICT in teaching and learning. Recent evaluations of the implementation of the curriculum 
reveal that this lack of attention to assessment is not confined to ICT. The ICT framework from the 
NCCA should help to address this deficit with regard to assessment of the use of ICT in the 
curriculum. However, given the difficulties that teachers have with assessment, it is very important 
that training be provided to facilitate the effective use of the framework and its assessment 
mechanisms. 

5.6 Developing ICT in the classroom 
The evaluation identified factors that both constrain and facilitate the development of ICT in primary 
classrooms. It is important that schools take account of these issues and work towards overcoming 
the constraining factors and building on those factors that contribute to the development of ICT. 

5.6.1 Factors that constrain the development of ICT in the 
curriculum 
In their reports on case-study schools, inspectors commented on the factors that constrained the 
development of ICT in schools. The main factors related to poor infrastructure and lack of technical 
support, low levels of competence and confidence on the part of teachers, insufficient time and 
funding, and planning-related issues. Respondents in the survey of teachers also reported 
infrastructural issues and lack of time as factors constraining the use of ICT in teaching and learning. 

5.6.2 Factors that facilitate the development of ICT in the 
curriculum 
The most prominent factors facilitating the development of ICT in the curriculum include the 
knowledge, enthusiasm, competence and experience of the teacher. The availability of appropriate 
and accessible professional development clearly has a critical role to play in developing teachers’ 
skills and confidence in the use of ICT. While teachers’ attitudes and competence are crucial, it is 
also essential that they have ready access to functioning hardware and appropriate software. In this 
regard, access to the internet and the availability of suitable peripherals are important factors in 
facilitating the development of ICT in the classroom. 

In the responses to their survey, teachers emphasised the ready availability of quality hardware in 
sufficient quantity as a central factor. An analysis of the responses to this survey also suggests that 
more experienced teachers gave priority to teacher training in ICT, while younger teachers gave 
priority to the improved use of existing hardware and software in teaching and the updating of 
specific software.

Adequate funding is clearly an issue in relation to the provision of resources, including both 
hardware and software. The grants provided to schools by the DES were recognised by teachers as 
making a significant contribution to the development of their school’s resources. However, as 
reported in chapter 1, schools find it necessary to supplement these grants through fund-raising and 
other local contributions. As the availability of resources continues to be a constraining factor on the 
development of ICT in schools, it must be concluded that additional funding for the development of 
schools’ ICT infrastructure is required. 

5.7 Findings and recommendations 
5.7.1 Main findings 
Teachers’ confidence and competence in the use of ICT 

• Only 30% of primary teachers rated their ability either “intermediate” or “advanced” with 
regard to using teaching and learning methods that are facilitated by ICT. Younger or more 
recently qualified teachers had a higher perception of their ICT skills than more experienced 
teachers. 

Incidence of ICT use 

• At primary level, inspectors reported evidence of the use of ICT to facilitate teaching and learning 
in 59% of classroom observations carried out as part of WSEs. However, they observed ICT 
actually used in only 22% of the lessons observed. 

Integration of ICT in teaching and learning 

• ICT is mainly used for the development of students’ writing, reading and numeracy skills. 
However, even this use of ICT is infrequent. 

• There is limited integration of ICT in the classroom. Where it is used, ICT predominates in core 
curricular areas, such as English and Mathematics, and SESE 

• There is limited use of ICT for the development of higher-order thinking skills, creative skills, social 
skills, independent working skills, and communication skills. 

• Students in junior classes experience a narrower range of ICT activity than their counterparts in 
senior classes. 

• Greater use is made of individual approaches to ICT-related activity than of paired, group or 
whole-class approaches.

• The evaluation found limited evidence of teachers engaging in the assessment of ICT-related 
activity in their classrooms or of its impact on teaching and learning. 

Students’ ICT use and competence 

• Most students reported being able to perform many basic computer tasks, such as turning a 
computer on and off or opening and saving a file. 

• More than 30% reported that they could not create a document, print a document, or log on to 
the internet, or would need help to do so. 

• The majority of students did not know how to create a presentation, use a spreadsheet, or send 
an attachment with an e-mail message. 

Use of resources 

• There is a reliance on computer applications in both mainstream and special-education classes to 
facilitate the use of ICT in teaching and learning. This use is mainly for the consolidation of 
numeracy and literacy skills. 

• While 69% of teachers reported using internet resources in planning and preparing for their 
teaching, fewer than a quarter (24%) use the internet in classroom practice. 

• There is very limited use of peripherals in primary schools, apart perhaps from the printer. 

Quality of provision 

• Inspectors were asked to describe the quality of the use of ICT in the teaching and learning they 
observed during the inspection period in classrooms visited. Only a quarter of inspectors’ reports 
on classroom observations suggest a competent or optimal level of performance. This proportion 
was higher for senior classes than for junior classes. 

Special-education settings 

• Approximately half the mainstream teachers reported using ICT to assist students with special 
educational needs in mainstream settings. A significantly higher use was reported by members of 
schools’ special-education support teams. 

• ICT is mainly used in special-education settings to develop reading, writing and numeracy skills, 
with the most common applications used being word-processing and content-rich software. 

• Inspectors’ observations of the use of ICT during classroom inspections suggest a range of quality 
of provision in special-education settings, with only a third of instances rated “competent” or 
“optimal.”

Factors constraining the use of ICT 

• Factors constraining the development of ICT in the curriculum include poor infrastructure and 
technical support, lack of competence or confidence on the part of teachers in the use of ICT, 
and funding. 

Factors facilitating the development of ICT 

• Factors facilitating the development of ICT in the curriculum include knowledge, competence and 
experience on the part of the teacher and access to functioning hardware, as well as funding. 

5.7.2 Recommendations 
Recommendations for policy-makers and policy advisors 

Teachers need to be supported in meeting the challenge of effectively integrating ICT in their 
classroom practices so that Irish classrooms can be placed at the forefront of advances in teaching 
practices and students’ learning techniques. This can be done in the following ways: 

• Consideration should be given to ensuring that teachers are provided with opportunities to 
develop skills that are directly applicable to the use of ICT in the classroom. This should be 
addressed in a strategic way through a combination of pre-service, induction and in-service 
training methods. 

• It is critical that teachers receive training in how to engage with the forthcoming “Framework for 
ICT in Curriculum and Assessment” to be published by the NCCA. 

• Education departments in third-level colleges should consider giving priority to the integration of 
ICT in the different curricular areas when preparing students for teaching. 

• It is important that classroom organisational matters be emphasised in support materials and 
courses for teachers so that they can exploit potential opportunities for using ICT in the 
classroom in accordance with the resources available. 

Recommendations for schools 

Teachers’ confidence and competence in using ICT 

• Schools should endeavour to adopt mechanisms to facilitate the sharing of good practice among 
members of the staff. For example, teachers who make effective use of ICT could act as mentors 
to colleagues who are not as confident in their use of the technology. 

• Teachers should be encouraged to become more critically reflective of their classroom practice, 
particularly their practice with regard to ICT.

Integration of ICT in teaching and learning 

• Schools should endeavour to provide all their students with an appropriate and equitable level of 
experience of ICT at all class levels. 

• Continuous efforts should be made in schools to develop the level of teachers’ access to ICT 
equipment. The provision of internet access in classrooms and access to a school network should 
be a priority for schools. The relevant DES grants will help facilitate this provision. 

• Teachers should regularly review their use of ICT with a view to expanding their repertoire of 
teaching strategies, including opportunities for students’ engagement with the technology. 

• Schools and teachers should make greater use of ICT to differentiate the implementation of the 
curriculum within the mainstream classroom. 

• Teachers should fully exploit the potential of ICT to facilitate the development of students’ literacy 
and numeracy skills. 

• Teachers should exploit the potential of ICT to develop a range of skills in students, including 
research and collaborative skills, creative writing skills, communication skills, and the higher-order 
skills of analysis, evaluation, and problem-solving. 

Resources 

• Schools should explore the use of as wide a range of resources and applications as possible, 
including educational software, peripherals, e-mail, presentation software, Scoilnet, the NCTE 
web site, and the internet. Schools could consider drawing up an inventory of software in 
accordance with its suitability for class levels and curricular applications. The NCTE’s Software 
Central web site, which provides advice and support to teachers on the use of software in their 
classrooms, is a useful resource in this regard. 

Special-education settings 

• In using ICT as a teaching aid for students with special educational needs, schools should 
endeavour to ensure that it is being used to support the widest range of students’ needs 
possible, both within classrooms and in withdrawal settings. 

• Schools should exploit the benefits of ICT in their assessment procedures and practices beyond 
purely administrative functions. This could include using ICT to assess, track and analyse students’ 
progress, using appropriate applications.
