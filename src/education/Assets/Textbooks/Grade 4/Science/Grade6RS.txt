6.1.1 Phases of the Moon 
Develop and use a model of the Sun-Earth-Moon system to describe the cyclic patterns 
of lunar phases, eclipses of the Sun and Moon, and seasons. Examples of models could 
be physical, graphical, or conceptual. 
In this section focus on observable patterns created by the positions 
of the Earth, Moon, and Sun throughout the month. The Earth-Moon- 
Sun System also creates observable patterns throughout the year. It 
is important to analyze this system in order to describe how it creates 
repeating, or cyclic, patterns, 
Phases of the Moon 
As the moon orbits around Earth, different parts of it appear to be illuminated by the Sun. 
The Moon does not produce any light of its own. It only reflects light from the Sun. The 
Moon sometimes appears fully illuminated and sometimes appears completely dark. 
Although it changes in appearance, the Moon is always half illuminated by the Sun. From 
our perspective on Earth, we see all, a portion, or none of the illuminated part of the Moon. 
These predictable patterns in the appearance of the Moon are referred to as phases of 
the Moon.

A full moon occurs when the Moon appears to be fully illuminated from our perspective 
on Earth. This happens when Earth is between the Moon and the Sun. As the Moon 
continues orbiting around Earth, the illuminated part that is visible from Earth decreases 
until the Moon appears to be completely dark. This phase is referred to as a new moon. 
As the cycle continues, the illuminated part of the Moon will appear to increase until it is 
fully illuminated again. This predictable pattern takes about 28 days. 
. Watch this video to see the phases change: http://go.nasa.gov/2dZEFVb 
The illumination of the Moon increases to a full moon and decreases to a new moon. This predictable 
pattern occurs about every 28 days. 
Focus Questions 
1. What causes the appearance of the Moon to change in a predictable? 
2. Where are the Sun, Earth, Moon positioned for full and new moons to occur? 
3. How does the Moon receive its light?

Seasons 
Visit this interactive to explore the causes of Earth’s seasons.

The days are getting warmer. Flowers begin to bloom. The sun appears higher in the sky, 
and daylight lasts longer. Spring seems like a fresh, new beginning. What causes these 
welcome changes? 
Some people think that Earth is closer to the Sun in the summer and farther away from 
the Sun in the winter, but that’s not true! Why can’t that be true? Because when it’s 
summer in one hemisphere, it’s winter in the other. 
The Earth revolves in an orbit, or the path a planet takes around an object. Initially 
believed to have a circular orbit, the Earth’s orbit is actually elliptical. As Earth moves 
throughout the year to new positions around the sun, the movement results in our four 
seasons: summer, autumn, winter, and spring. 
The distance from the sun doesn’t have much effect on the heating and cooling of Earth. 
In fact, the Northern Hemisphere is closest to the Sun during winter. So, why do we, in 
the Northern Hemisphere, feel coldest when we are closest to the Sun? 
Earth’s axis of rotation, or imaginary poles on which Earth spins, is tilted at a 23.5 degree 
angle. Because of this tilt, one of the hemispheres is angled toward the Sun. This causes 
that hemisphere to receive more direct energy from the Sun. 
As Earth revolves around the 
Sun, the axis of rotation 
maintains its tilt. The axis 
always points in the same 
direction, which is toward the 
North Star (Polaris). The 
combination of the Earth’s 
revolution around the Sun and 
Earth’s 23.5 degree angle tilt 
are the reasons we have 
seasons.

6.2.1 Atoms and Molecules 
Develop models to show that molecules are made of different kinds, proportions and 
quantities of atoms. Emphasize understanding that there are differences between atoms 
and molecules, and that certain combinations of atoms form specific molecules. 
Examples of simple molecules could include water (H2O), atmospheric oxygen (O2), and 
carbon dioxide (CO2). 
In this section focus on proportions and quantities. There are differences 
between atoms and molecules. It is important to develop models that show 
how different proportions and quantities of atoms form different molecules. 
Atoms and Molecules 
Everything you can see, touch, smell, feel, and taste is made of atoms. Atoms are the 
basic building-block of all matter (including you and me, and everyone else you'll ever 
meet), if we want to know about what something is made of, then we have to know a few 
things about these incredibly small particles. 
Smallest Building Blocks 
Everyday experiences should convince you that matter is found in many forms, yet all 
matter you have ever seen is made of atoms. Atoms are the smallest unit of matter. These 
atoms combine to form molecules, which can be made up of the same or different types 
of atoms. Molecules are formed when two or more atoms link up. For instance, a molecule 
of oxygen that we breathe is made of two atoms of oxygen (O2). A molecule of water is 
made of two atoms of hydrogen (H2) and one atom of oxygen (O). All water molecules 
have the same ratio: two hydrogen to one oxygen (H2O). The figure on the right shows a 
water molecule that has two hydrogen atoms (shown in gray) bonded to one oxygen atom 
(shown in red). 
To help develop your model of of atoms and molecules, think of interlocking building 
blocks. Each block is individual with its own color, shape, and size like an atom. You can 
combine these blocks together to form a simple structure like a molecule. 

www.ck12.org 
55 
Two things are important to know about molecules: 
. A molecule always has the same type of atoms in the same proportions. For 
example, carbon dioxide always has two atoms of oxygen for each atom of carbon, 
and water always has two atoms of hydrogen for each atom of oxygen. 
. A pure substance always has the same composition throughout. For example, all 
the water in the ocean has the same type and proportion of atoms. 
Properties of Molecules 
The properties of a molecule are different from the properties of the atoms that form them. 
That’s because atoms in a molecule combine and become an entirely different substance 
with its own unique properties. Do you put salt on your food? Table salt is the molecule 
sodium chloride. A molecule of table salt, contains an atom of sodium and an atom of 
chlorine. As shown in the figure below, sodium is a solid that reacts explosively with water, 
and chlorine is a poisonous gas. But together in table salt, sodium and chlorine form a 
harmless unreactive compound that you can safely eat. 
Focus Questions 
1. How would a model of an atom and molecule be different? 
2. How would you model a carbon dioxide molecule that has one atom of carbon 
and two atoms of oxygen (CO2)?

Gases have the following characteristics: 
. No definite shape (takes the shape of its container) 
. No definite volume 
. Particles move in random motion with little or no attraction to each other 
How tightly atoms and molecules are packed together is referred to as density. Solids are 
denser than liquids. Liquids are denser than gases. 
What Is Heat? 
Heat is the transfer of thermal energy between substances. Thermal energy is the energy 
causing the particles of matter to move. Temperature is the average measure of that 
energy. Thermal energy always moves from matter with greater thermal energy to matter 
with less thermal energy, so it moves from warmer to cooler substances. You can see 
this in the figure below. 
Faster-moving particles of the warmer substance bump into and transfer some of their 
energy to slower-moving particles of the cooler substance. Thermal energy is transferred 
in this way until both substances have the same thermal energy and temperature. 

www.ck12.org 
60 
As thermal energy is transferred, materials expand as temperature increases. The density 
of a substance is temperature dependent and usually decreases as temperature 
increases. Density is an important physical property of matter. It reflects how closely 
packed and the arrangement of particle in matter. For instance, a golf ball and a table 
tennis ball are about the same size. However, the golf ball is much heavier than the table 
tennis ball. Now imagine a similar size ball made out of lead. That would be very heavy 
indeed! What are we comparing? By comparing the mass of an object relative to its size, 
we are studying a property called density. Matter with less density will rise and matter 
with greater density will sink. 
How do you cool down a glass of room-temperature cola? You probably add ice cubes to 
it, as in the figure to the right. You might think that the ice cools down the cola, but in fact, 
it works the other way around. The warm cola heats up the ice. Thermal energy from the 
warm cola is transferred to the much colder ice, causing it to melt. The cola loses thermal 
energy in the process, so its temperature falls. 
Changes in States of Matter 
A change of state occurs whenever matter changes from one state to another, for 
example a solid changing to a liquid. This change is an effect of energy being transferred 
from one substance to another. Changes of state are physical changes, meaning they 
are reversible changes and do not change how molecules are combined. For example, 
when fog changes to water vapor, it is still water (H2O) and can change back to liquid 
water again. Matter may change back and forth between these states. 
As energy in a substance is transferred, it causes a change in its state. In the previous 
example, ice was added to a cola. The energy was transferred from the warmer cola to 
the cooler ice. This caused the ice to melt and change from a solid to a liquid. 
Types of Phase Changes 
Melting occurs when particles of a solid absorb enough energy to partly overcome the 
force of attraction holding them together. This allows them to move out of their fixed 
positions and slip over one another. The solid becomes a liquid. 
The process in which water or any other liquid changes to a solid is called freezing. 
Freezing occurs when a liquid cools to a point at which its particles no longer have enough 

www.ck12.org 
61 
energy to overcome the force of attraction between them. Instead, the particles remain in 
fixed positions, crowded closely together. 
When air cools, it can hold less water vapor, so some of the water vapor in the air changed 
to liquid water. The process in which water vapor—or another gas—changes to a liquid 
is called condensation. Another common example of condensation is pictured in the figure 
below. 
This picture shows the contrail (condensation trail) left behind by a jet. Water vapor in its 
exhaust gases condensed on dust particles in the air. 
Evaporation is the process in which a liquid changes to a gas. It occurs when individual 
liquid particles at the exposed surface of the liquid absorb just enough energy to 
overcome the force of attraction with other liquid particles. If the surface particles are 
moving in the right direction, they will pull away from the liquid and move into the air 
becoming a gas. 
Focus Questions: 
1. Draw a model that shows the motion of particles in a solid, liquid and a gas. 
2. What is the effect as heat energy is added to a bar of chocolate? 
3. Ice floats in water. What does this tell us about the ice’s density?

6.2.3 Heat Energy 
Plan and carry out an investigation to determine the relationship between temperature, 
the amount of heat transferred, and the change of average particle motion in various types 
or amounts of matter. Emphasize recording and evaluating data, and communicating the 
results of the investigation. 
In this section, focus on the relationship between heat transfer and the 
average particle motion in matter. 
Heat Energy and Particle Motion 
When heat flows into an object, its thermal energy increases and so does its temperature. 
The amount of temperature increase depends on three things: 1) how much heat was 
added, 2) the size of the object, and 3) the material of which the object is made. 
Thermal energy and temperature are closely related. Both reflect the amount of moving 
particles of matter as energy. However, temperature is the average measure of that 
energy, whereas thermal energy is the total energy within a system. Does this mean that 
matter with a lower temperature has less thermal energy than matter with a higher 
temperature? Not necessarily. Another factor also affects thermal energy. The other 
factor is mass. 
The soup is boiling hot and has a temperature of 100 °C, whereas the water in the tub is 
just comfortably warm, with a temperature of about 38 °C. Although the water in the tub 
has a much lower temperature, it has greater thermal energy. This is because 
temperature is a measure of the average energy of the particles, rather than a measure 
of the total energy. The particles of soup have a greater average energy than the particles 
of water in the tub; the soup has a higher temperature. However, the mass of the water 
in the tub is much greater than the mass of the soup in the pot. This means that there are 
many more particles of water in the tub than particles in the soup. All those moving

6.2.4 Engineering Design 
Design an object, tool, or process that minimizes or maximizes heat energy transfer. 
Identify criteria and constraints, develop a prototype for iterative testing, analyze data 
from testing, and propose modifications for optimizing the design solution. Emphasize 
demonstrating how the structure of differing materials allows them to function as either 
conductors or insulators. 
Engineering uses scientific knowledge to solve human needs and 
wants. In this section focus on how the structure of different materials 
helps them function as conductors or insulators. 
Engineering Design 
The process of designing a new technology includes much more than just coming up with 
a good idea. Possible limitations, or constraints, on the design must be taken into account. 
These might include factors such as the cost or safety of the new product or process. 
Making and testing a model of the design are also important. These steps ensure that the 
design actually works to solve the problem. This process also gives the designer a chance 
to find problems and modify the design if necessary. No solution is perfect, but testing 
and refining a design assures that the technology will provide a workable solution to the 
problem it is intended to solve. 
Engineering design can be accomplished in many different ways. Some of the steps have 
to be repeated, and the steps may not always be done in the same sequence, but there 
are some basic steps to solving an engineering problem. First, an engineer defines the 
problem that needs to be solved, and researches what criteria and constraints they will 
need to consider. In order to generate many possible solutions, engineers brainstorming 
Consider the problem of developing a solar-powered car. Many questions would have to 
be researched in the design process. For example, what is the best shape for gathering 
the sun’s rays? How will sunlight be converted to useable energy to run the car? Will a 
back-up energy source be needed? After researching the answers, possible designs are 
developed. This generally takes imagination as well as sound reasoning. Then a model 
must be designed and tested. This allows any problems with the design to be worked out 
before a final design is selected and produced. 
Heat Energy Transfer: Thermal Conductors 
Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy between particles of matter that are touching. 
Thermal conduction occurs when particles of warmer matter bump into particles of cooler 
matter and transfer some of their thermal energy to the cooler particles. Conduction is 
usually faster in certain solids and liquids than in gases. Materials that are good 
conductors of thermal energy are called thermal conductors. 

www.ck12.org 
69 
Besides the heating element inside a toaster, another example of a thermal conductor is 
a metal radiator, like the one in the figure below. When hot water flows through the coils 
of the radiator, the metal quickly heats up by conduction and then radiates thermal energy 
into the surrounding air. 
Thermal Insulators 
One way to retain your own thermal energy on a cold day is to wear clothes that trap air. 
That’s because air, like other gases, is a poor conductor of thermal energy. The particles 
of gases are relatively far apart, so they don’t bump into each other or into other things 
as often as the more closely spaced particles of liquids or solids. Therefore, particles of 
gases have fewer opportunities to transfer thermal energy. Materials that are poor thermal 
conductors are called thermal insulators. Down-filled snowsuits, like those in the figure 
below, are good thermal insulators because their feather filling traps a lot of air. 
Another example of a thermal insulator is pictured in the figure below. The picture shows 
fluffy pink insulation inside the attic of a home. Like the down filling in a snowsuit, the

6.3.1 Water Cycle 
Develop a model to describe how the cycling of water through Earth’s systems is driven 
by energy from the Sun, gravitational forces, and density. 
In this section, focus on energy. Think about how the transfer of energy 
drives the motion and cycling of water throughout the water cycle. 
The Water Cycle 
The water molecule found in your glass of water today could have erupted from a volcano 
early in Earth's history. In the intervening billions of years, the molecule probably spent 
time in a glacier or far below the ground. The molecule surely was high up in the 
atmosphere and maybe deep in the belly of a dinosaur. Because of the unique properties 
of water, water molecules can cycle through almost anywhere on Earth. Where will that 
water molecule go next? 
Water continuously moves between living organisms, such as plants, and non-living 
things, such as clouds, rivers, and oceans. The water cycle does not have a starting or 
ending point. It is an endless recycling process that involves oceans, lakes and other 
bodies of water, as well as the land surfaces and the atmosphere. One possible pathway 
water could follow is: 
. Water evaporates from the surface of the ocean. As the water vapor rises, it 
collects and is stored in clouds. 
. As water cools in the atmosphere it condenses to form clouds. Condensation is 
when water vapor turns into liquid water. 
. Water leaves the atmosphere as precipitation. Precipitation includes rain, snow, 
hail, and sleet. Precipitation returns the water to the Earth’s surface. 
. When precipitation falls to the surface, the water can sink into the ground to 
become part of the underground water reservoir, also known as groundwater. 
Much of this underground water is stored in aquifers, which are porous layers of 
rock that can hold water. 
Most precipitation that occurs over land is not absorbed by the soil. This water remains 
on the surface and is called runoff. Runoff collects in streams and rivers and eventually 
flows back into the ocean. 
Water also moves through the living organisms. Plants soak up large amounts of water 
through their roots. The water then moves up the plant and evaporates from the leaves 
in a process called transpiration. Another name for transpiration is evapotranspiration. 
The process of transpiration, like evaporation, returns water back into the atmosphere. 

www.ck12.org 
76 
Forces that Drive the Water Cycle 
Solar Energy 
The Sun provides the energy that drives the water cycle. For water to evaporate it requires 
an input of energy. The Sun directly impacts the water cycle by supplying the energy 
needed for evaporation. 
Density 
As clouds accumulate more water they become more dense. Water will fall from the 
clouds as precipitation to the surface of the Earth. 
Gravity 
Clouds will move water from the ocean to the tops of the mountains. Water evaporated 
from the ocean will be deposited on land as precipitation. Gravity pulls the water down 
to the oceans where the process continues. 
Earth’s Water Reservoirs 
Water can be found in many different locations on the Earth. It can be found in oceans, 
clouds, puddles or living things. Each of these locations is called a reservoir. 

www.ck12.org 
77 
Oceans 
Most of Earth’s water is stored in the oceans. In fact, 97% of the Earth’s water is in this 
reservoir. Water can remain in the ocean for hundreds or thousands of years. Or it can 
evaporate in days or hours. 
Atmosphere 
When water absorbs energy it will change from a liquid to water vapor. The Sun’s energy 
can evaporate water from the ocean surface or from lakes, streams, or puddles on land. 
The water vapor remains in the atmosphere until it condenses to become tiny droplets of 
liquid. The droplets gather in clouds, which are blown about the globe by wind. As the 
water droplets in the clouds collide and grow, they fall from the sky as precipitation. 
Precipitation can be rain, sleet, hail, or snow. Sometimes precipitation falls back into the 
ocean and sometimes it falls onto the land surface. 
Streams and Lakes 
When water falls from the sky as rain it may enter streams and rivers that flow downward 
to lakes and oceans. Water that falls as snow may sit on a mountain for several months. 
Snow may become ice in a glacier, where it will remain for hundreds or thousands of 
years. Snow and ice slowly melt over time to become liquid water, which provides a 
steady flow of fresh water to streams, rivers, and lakes. A water droplet falling as rain 
could also become part of a stream or a lake. At the surface, the water will eventually 
evaporate and reenter the atmosphere. 
Soil 
A significant amount of water seeps into the ground. Soil moisture is an important 
reservoir for water (Figure below). Water trapped in soil is important for plants to grow. 
The moisture content of soil in the United States varies greatly. (From ck12) 

www.ck12.org 
78 
Groundwater 
Water may seep through dirt and rock below the soil and then through pores infiltrating 
the ground to go into Earth’s groundwater system. Groundwater enters aquifers that may 
store fresh water for centuries. Alternatively, the water may come to the surface through 
springs or find its way back to the oceans. Water can remain in this reservoir for hundreds 
or even thousands of years. 
Biosphere 
Plants and animals depend on water to live. Plants and animals are another place water 
is stored. Plants take up water from the soil and release large amounts of water vapor 
into the air through their leaves in transpiration. Water will move quickly through this 
reservoir. 
Focus Questions: 
1. Explain how energy from the Sun affects the movement of water through the 
water cycle. 
2. What is a water reservoir? List 3 examples of water reservoirs. 
3. Describe how water can change states as it moves through the water cycle?
