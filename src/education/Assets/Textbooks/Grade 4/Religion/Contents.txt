Preface 
Education is the key to development. A progressively improved education system largely 
determines the pace and the quality or national development. To reflect the hopes and 
aspirations or the people and the socio-economic and cultural reality in the context of the 
post independent Bangladesh, new textbooks were introduced in the beginning of the 1980s 
folIowing the recommendations of the National Curriculum and Textbook Committee. 
In 1994, in accordance with the need for change and development, the textbooks of lower 
secondary, secondary and higher secondary were revised and modified. The textbooks from 
classes -VI to IX were written in 1995. In 2000, almost all the textbooks were rationally 
evaluated and necessary revision were made. In 2008 the Ministry or Education formed a 
Task Force for Education. According to the advice and guidance of the Task Force, the 
cover, spelling and information in the textbooks were updated and corrected. 
To make assessment more meaningful and in accordance with the need of the curriculum, 
Creative Questions and Multiple Choice Questions are given at the end of each chapter. It 
is hoped that this will reduce the dependency or students on rote memorisation. The 
students will be able to apply the knowledge they have gained to judge, analyse and 
evaluate real life situation. 
Islamic Studies is a compulsory subject in lower secondary and secondary class. Lower 
Secondary textbook reflcets the curriculum and learning outcomes. Aqaid, Iba'dat, Qur'an 
Majid, Hadith sharif, Akhlaq and leading an ideal life has been presented briefly in this 
class. The prineiples of Islam, the ethics and values are presentel in simple language using 
examples, stories, lives of noble people, so that learners can know about a better life. 
This book or Islamic Studies for class IX & X is the English Version of the original 
textbook entitled 'Islam Dharma Shiksha' written in Bangla. 
We know that curriculum development is a continuous process on which textbooks are 
written. Any logical and formative suggestions for improvement will be considered with 
care. On the event of the golden jubilee of the independence of Bangladesh in 2021, we 
want to be a part of the ceaseless effort to build a prosperous Bangladesh. 
In spite of sincere efforts in translation. Editing and printing inadvertent errors and 
omissions may be found in the book. However our efforts to make it more refined and 
impeccable will continue any constructive suggestion towards its further improvement 
will he gratefully considered. 
I thank those who have assisted us with their intellect and efforts in the writing, editing 
and rational evaluation of this book. We hope that the book will be useful for the students 
for whom it is written.

(In the name of Allah, the most Beneficient, the most Merciful) 
The range of Islam is immensely wide. All the aspects of a man's life from his 
birth to death, and even the life after death, come under the purview of Islam. This 
book, entitled Islamic Studies, is comprised of five chapters under the captions of 
'Aqaid', 'Sources of Shariat', 'Iba'dat', 'Akhlaq' and 'Biographies of Some Ideal 
Persons' described in a short compass.
