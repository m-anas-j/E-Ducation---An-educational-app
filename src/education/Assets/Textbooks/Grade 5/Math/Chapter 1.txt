1.1 Introduction 
Chapter 1 
Knowing our Numbers 
Counting things is easy for us now. We can count objects in large numbers, 
for example, the number of students in the school, and represent them 
through numerals. We can also communicate large numbers using suitable 
number names. 

It is not as if we always knew how to convey large quantities in conversation 
or through symbols. Many thousands years ago, people knew only small 
numbers. Gradually, they learnt how to handle larger numbers. They also learnt 
how to express large numbers in symbols. All this came through collective 
efforts of human beings. Their path was not easy, they struggled all along the 
way. In fact, the development of whole of Mathematics can be understood 
this way. As human beings progressed, there was greater need for development 
of Mathematics and as a result Mathematics grew further and faster. 

We use numbers and know many things about them. Numbers help us 
count concrete objects. They help us to say which collection of objects 
is bigger and arrange them in order e.g., first, second, etc. Numbers are 
used in many different contexts and in many ways. Think about various 
situations where we use numbers. List five distinct situations in which 
numbers are used. 

We enjoyed working with numbers in our previous classes. We have added, 
subtracted, multiplied and divided them. We also looked for patterns in number 
sequences and done many other interesting things with numbers. In this chapter, 
we shall move forward on such interesting things with a bit of review and 
revision as well. 



MATHEMATICS 

1.2 Comparing Numbers 
As we have done quite a lot of this earlier, let us see if we remember which is 
the greatest among these : 


(i) 92, 392, 4456, 89742 

(ii) 1902, 1920, 9201, 9021, 9210 
So, we know the answers. 
Discuss with your friends, how you find the number that is the greatest. 

Can you instantly find the greatest and the smallest numbers in each row? 
1. 382, 4972, 18, 59785, 750. Ans. 59785 is the greatest and 
18 is the smallest. 
2. 1473, 89423, 100, 5000, 310. Ans. ____________________ 
3. 1834, 75284, 111, 2333, 450 . Ans. ____________________ 
4. 2853, 7691, 9999, 12002, 124. Ans. ____________________ 
Was that easy? Why was it easy? 
We just looked at the number of digits and found the answer. 
The greatest number has the most thousands and the smallest is 
only in hundreds or in tens. 

Make five more problems of this kind and give to your friends 

to solve. 
Now, how do we compare 4875 and 3542? 
This is also not very difficult.These two numbers have the 

same number of digits. They are both in thousands. But the digit 
at the thousands place in 4875 is greater than that in 3542. 
Therefore, 4875 is greater than 3542. 

Find the greatest and the smallest 
numbers. 
(a) 4536, 4892, 4370, 4452. 
(b) 15623, 15073, 15189, 15800. 
(c) 25286, 25245, 25270, 25210. 
(d) 6895, 23787, 24569, 24659. 
Next tell which is greater, 4875 or 
4542? Here too the numbers have the 
same number of digits. Further, the digits 
at the thousands place are same in both. 
What do we do then? We move to the 
next digit, that is to the digit at the 
hundreds place. The digit at the hundreds 
place is greater in 4875 than in 4542. 
Therefore, 4875 is greater than 4542. 


2 


KNOWING OUR NUMBERS 

If the digits at hundreds place are also same in the two numbers, then what 
do we do? 

Compare 4875 and 4889 ; Also compare 4875 and 4879. 

1.2.1 How many numbers can you make? 
Suppose, we have four digits 7, 8, 3, 5. Using these digits we want to make 
different 4-digit numbers such that no digits are repeated in a number. Thus, 
7835 is allowed, but 7735 is not. Make as many 4-digit numbers as you can. 

Which is the greatest number you can get? Which is the smallest number? 
The greatest number is 8753 and the smallest is 3578. 
Think about the arrangement of the digits in both. Can you say how the largest 

number is formed? Write down your procedure. 


1. Use the given digits without repetition and make the greatest and smallest 
4-digit numbers. 
(a) 2, 8, 7, 4 (b) 9, 7, 4, 1 (c) 4, 7, 5, 0 
(d) 1, 7, 6, 2 (e) 5, 4, 0, 3 
(Hint : 0754 is a 3-digit number.) 
2. Now make the greatest and the smallest 4-digit numbers by using any one 
digit twice. 
(a) 3, 8, 7 (b) 9, 0, 5 (c) 0, 4, 9 (d) 8, 5, 1 
(Hint : Think in each case which digit will you use twice.) 
3. Make the greatest and the smallest 4-digit numbers using any four different 
digits with conditions as given. 
(a) Digit 7 is always at Greatest 9

4. Take two digits, say 2 and 3. Make 4-digit numbers using both the digits equal 
number of times. 
Which is the greatest number? 
Which is the smallest number? 
How many different numbers can you make in all? 

Stand in proper order 

1. Who is the tallest? 
2. Who is the shortest? 
(a) Can you arrange them in the increasing order of their heights? 
(b) Can you arrange them in the decreasing order of their heights? 
Ramhari Dolly Mohan Shashi

Which to buy? 

Sohan and Rita went 
to buy an almirah. 
There were many 
almirahs available 
with their price tags. 

(a) Can you arrange their prices in increasing 
order? 
(b) Can you arrange their prices in 
decreasing order? 
Think of five more situations 
where you compare three or 
more quantities. 
Ascending order Ascending order means arrangement from the smallest to the 

greatest. 
Descending order Descending order means arrangement from the greatest to 
the smallest.

KNOWING OUR NUMBERS 

1. Arrange the following numbers in ascending order : 
(a) 847, 9754, 8320, 571 (b) 9801, 25751, 36501, 38802 
2. Arrange the following numbers in descending order : 
(a) 5000, 7500, 85400, 7861 (b) 1971, 45321, 88715, 92547 
Make ten such examples of ascending/descending order and solve them. 
1.2.2 Shifting digits 
Have you thought what fun it would be if the digits in a number could shift 
(move) from one place to the other? 

Think about what would happen to 182. It could become as large as 821 
and as small as 128. Try this with 391 as well. 

Now think about this. Take any 3-digit number and exchange the digit at 
the hundreds place with the digit at the ones place. 

(a) Is the new number greater than the former one? 
(b) Is the new number smaller than the former number? 
Write the numbers formed in both ascending and descending order. 
Before

Exchanging the 1st and the 3rd tiles. 

After 

5 9 7 
If you exchange the 1st and the 3rd tiles (i.e. digits), in which case does the 
number become greater? In which case does it become smaller? 
Try this with a 4-digit number. 

1.2.3 Introducing 10,000 

We know that beyond 99 there is no 2-digit number. 99 is the greatest 2-digit 
number. Similarly, the greatest 3-digit number is 999 and the greatest 4-digit 
number is 9999. What shall we get if we add 1 to 9999? 

Look at the pattern : 9 + 1 = 10 = 10 × 1 
99 + 1 = 100 = 10 × 10 
999 + 1 = 1000 = 10 × 100 

We observe that 
Greatest single digit number + 1 = smallest 2-digit number 
Greatest 2-digit number + 1 = smallest 3-digit number 
Greatest 3-digit number + 1 = smallest 4-digit number 

5 

MATHEMATICS 

Should not we then expect that on adding 1 to the greatest 4-digit number, 
we would get the smallest 5-digit number, that is 9999 + 1 = 10000. 
The new number which comes next to 9999 is 10000. It is called 
ten thousand. Further, we expect 10000 = 10 × 1000. 

1.2.4 Revisiting place value 
You have done this quite earlier, and you will certainly remember the expansion 
of a 2-digit number like 78 as 
78 = 70 + 8 = 7 × 10 + 8 
Similarly, you will remember the expansion of a 3-digit number like 278 as 
278 = 200 + 70 + 8 = 2 × 100 + 7 × 10 + 8 

We say, here, 8 is at ones place, 7 is at tens place and 2 at hundreds place. 
Later on we extended this idea to 4-digit numbers. 
For example, the expansion of 5278 is 

5278 = 5000 + 200 + 70 + 8 
= 5 × 1000 + 2 × 100 + 7 × 10 + 8 
Here, 8 is at ones place, 7 is at tens place, 2 is at hundreds place and 5 is at 
thousands place. 
With the number 10000 known to us, we may extend the idea further. We 
may write 5-digit numbers like 
45278 = 4 × 10000 + 5 × 1000 + 2 × 100 + 7 × 10 + 8 

We say that here 8 is at ones place, 7 at tens place, 2 at hundreds place, 
5 at thousands place and 4 at ten thousands place. The number is read as forty 
five thousand, two hundred seventy eight. Can you now write the smallest 
and the greatest 5-digit numbers? 

Read and expand the numbers wherever there are blanks. 
Number Number Name Expansion 
20000 twenty thousand 2 × 10000 
26000 twenty six thousand 2 × 10000 + 6 × 1000 
38400 thirty eight thousand 3 × 10000 + 8 × 1000 
four hundred + 4 × 100 
65740 sixty five thousand 6 × 10000 + 5 × 1000

Write five more 5-digit numbers, read them and expand them. 
1.2.5 Introducing 1,00,000 

Which is the greatest 5-digit number? 
Adding 1 to the greatest 5-digit number, should give the smallest 
6-digit number : 99,999 + 1 = 1,00,000 
This number is named one lakh. One lakh comes next to 99,999. 
10 × 10,000 = 1,00,000 
We may now write 6-digit numbers in the expanded form as 
2,46,853 = 2 × 1,00,000 + 4 × 10,000 + 6 × 1,000 + 
8 × 100 + 5 × 10 +3 × 1 

This number has 3 at ones place, 5 at tens place, 8 at hundreds place, 6 at 
thousands place, 4 at ten thousands place and 2 at lakh place. Its number 
name is two lakh forty six thousand eight hundred fifty three. 

Read and expand the numbers wherever there are blanks.

1.2.6 Larger numbers 
If we add one more to the greatest 6-digit number we get the smallest 7-digit 
number. It is called ten lakh. 

Write down the greatest 6-digit number and the smallest 7-digit number. 
Write the greatest 7-digit number and the smallest 8-digit number. The smallest 


8-digit number is called one crore. 
Complete the pattern : 
9 + 1 =10 
99 + 1 = 100 
999 + 1 = _______ 
9,999 + 1 = _______ 
99,999 + 1 = _______ 
9,99,999 + 1 = _______ 
99,99,999 + 1 = 1,00,00,000 

Remember 
1 hundred = 10 tens 
1 thousand = 10 hundreds 
= 100 tens 
1 lakh = 100 thousands 
= 1000 hundreds 
1 crore = 100 lakhs 
= 10,000 thousands 

We come across large numbers in 
many different situations. 
For example, while the number of 
children in your class would be a 
2-digit number, the number of 
children in your school would be 
a 3 or 4-digit number. 
The number of people in the nearby town would be much larger. 
Is it a 5 or 6 or 7-digit number? 
Do you know the number of people in your state? 
How many digits would that number have? 
What would be the number of grains in a sack full of wheat? A 5-digit number, 
a 6-digit number or more? 
1. What is 10  1 =? 
2. What is 100  1 =? 
3. What is 10,000  1 =? 
4. What is 1,00,000  1 =? 
5. What is 1,00,00,000  1 =? 
(Hint : Use the said pattern.) 
1. Give five examples where the number of things counted would be more than 
6-digit number. 
2. Starting from the greatest 6-digit number, write the previous five numbers in 
descending order. 
3. Starting from the smallest 8-digit number, write the next five numbers in 
ascending order and read them.

1.2.7 An aid in reading and writing large numbers 
Try reading the following numbers : 
(a) 279453 (b) 5035472 
(c) 152700375 (d) 40350894 

Was it difficult? 
Did you find it difficult to keep track? 
Sometimes it helps to use indicators to read and write large numbers. 

Shagufta uses indicators which help her to read and write large numbers. 
Her indicators are also useful in writing the expansion of numbers. For example, 
she identifies the digits in ones place, tens place and hundreds place in 257 by 
writing them under the tables O, T and H as 

H T O Expansion 
2 5 7 2 × 100 + 5 × 10 + 7 × 1 
Similarly, for 2902, 
Th H T O Expansion 
2 9 0 2 2 × 1000 + 9 × 100 + 0 × 10 + 2 × 1 

One can extend this idea to numbers upto lakh as seen in the following 
table. (Let us call them placement boxes). Fill the entries in the blanks left.

Use of commas 

You must have noticed that in writing large numbers in the 

While writing 

sections above, we have often used commas. Commas help us 

number names, 
in reading and writing large numbers. In our Indian System 

we do not use 
of Numeration we use ones, tens, hundreds, thousands and commas. 
then lakhs and crores. Commas are used to mark thousands, 
lakhs and crores. The first comma comes after hundreds place (three digits from the 
right) and marks thousands. The second comma comes two digits later (five digits 
from the right). It comes after ten thousands place and marks lakh. The third comma 
comes after anothertwodigits(seven digitsfrom the right). Itcomes aftertenlakh 
place and marks crore. 

For example, 5, 08, 01, 592 

3, 32, 40, 781 

7, 27, 05, 062 

Try reading the numbers given above. Write five more numbers in this form and 
read them. 

International System of Numeration 

In the International System of Numeration, as it is being used we have ones, 
tens, hundreds, thousands and then millions. One million is a thousand 
thousands. Commas are used to mark thousands and millions. It comes after 
every three digits from the right. The first comma marks thousands and the 
next comma marks millions. For example, the number 50,801,592 is read in 
the International System as fifty million eight hundred one thousand five 
hundred ninety two. In the Indian System, it is five crore eight lakh one thousand 
five hundred ninety two. 

How many lakhs make a million? 

How many millions make a crore? 

Take three large numbers. Express them in both Indian and International 

Numeration systems. 

This may interest you : 

To express numbers larger than a million, a billion is used in the International 

System of Numeration: 1 billion = 1000 million.

1.3 Large Numbers in Practice 
In earlier classes, we have learnt that we use centimetre (cm) as a unit of length. 
For measuring the length of a pencil, the width of a book or 
notebooks etc., we use centimetres. Our ruler has marks on each centimetre. 

For measuring the thickness of a pencil, however, we find centimetre too big. 
We use millimetre (mm) to show the thickness of a pencil. 

1. How many 
centimetres make a 
kilometre? 
2. Name five large cities 
in India. Find their 
population. Also, find 
the distance in 
kilometres between 
each pair of these cities. 
(a) 10 millimetres = 1 centimetre 
To measure the length of the classroom or 
the school building, we shall find 
centimetre too small. We use metre for the 
purpose. 

(b) 1 metre = 100 centimetres 
= 1000 millimetres 
Even metre is too small, when we have to 
state distances between cities, say, Delhi 
and Mumbai, or Chennai and Kolkata. For 

12 

this we need kilometres (km). 


KNOWING OUR NUMBERS 

(c) 1 kilometre = 1000 metres 
How many millimetres make 1 kilometre? 
Since 1 m = 1000 mm 
1 km = 1000 m = 1000 × 1000 mm = 10,00,000 mm 
We go to the market to buy rice or wheat; we buy it in 
kilograms (kg). But items like ginger or chillies which 
we do not need in large quantities, we buy in grams (g). 
We know 1 kilogram = 1000 grams. 

Have you noticed the weight of the medicine tablets 
given to the sick? It is very small. It is in milligrams 
(mg). 

1 gram = 1000 milligrams. 

What is the capacity of a bucket for holding water? It 

is usually 20 litres (
..
). Capacity is given in litres. But 

sometimes we need a smaller unit, the millilitres. 

A bottle of hair oil, a cleaning liquid or a soft drink 

have labels which give the quantity of liquid inside in 
millilitres (ml). 
1 litre = 1000 millilitres. 

Note that in all these units we have some words 
common like kilo, milli and centi. You should remember 
that among these kilo is the greatest and milli is the 
smallest; kilo shows 1000 times greater, milli shows 
1000 times smaller, i.e. 1 kilogram = 1000 grams, 
1 gram = 1000 milligrams. 

Similarly, centi shows 100 times smaller, i.e. 1 metre = 100 centimetres. 

1. How many 
milligrams 
make one 
kilogram?

2,00,000

KNOWING OUR NUMBERS 

We have done a lot of problems that have addition, subtraction, multiplication 
and division. We will try solving some more here. Before starting, look at these 
examples and follow the methods used. 

Example 1 : Population of Sundarnagar was 2,35,471 in the year 1991. In the 
year 2001 it was found to be increased by 72,958. What was the population of 
the city in 2001? 

Solution : Population of the city in 2001 

= Population of the city in 1991 + Increase in population 

= 2,35,471 + 72,958 
Now, 235471 

+ 72958 

308429 

Salma added them by writing 235471 as 200000 + 35000 + 471 and 
72958 as 72000 + 958. She got the addition as 200000 + 107000 + 1429 = 308429. 
Mary added it as 200000 + 35000 + 400 + 71 + 72000 + 900 + 58 = 308429 

Answer : Population of the city in 2001 was 3,08,429. 

All three methods are correct. 

Example 2 : In one state, the number of bicycles sold in the year 2002-2003 
was 7,43,000. In the year 2003-2004, the number of bicycles sold was 8,00,100. 
In which year were more bicycles sold? and how many more? 

Solution : Clearly, 8,00,100 is more than 7,43,000. So, in that state, more 
bicycles were sold in the year 2003-2004 than in 2002-2003.

 Now, 800100 Check the answer by adding 

743000 
+ 57100 

 743000 


057100 

800100 (the answer is right) 

Can you think of alternative ways of solving this problem? 
Answer : 57,100 more bicycles were sold in the year 2003-2004. 

Example 3 : The town newspaper is published every day. One copy has 
12 pages. Everyday 11,980 copies are printed. How many total pages are 
printed everyday? 

15 

MATHEMATICS 


Solution : Each copy has 12 pages. Hence, 11,980 copies will have 
12 × 11,980 pages. What would this number be? More than 1,00,000 or lesser. 
Try to estimate. 

Now, 11980 

× 12 
23960 
+ 119800 

143760 

Answer:Everyday 1,43,760 pages are printed. 
Example 4 : The number of sheets of paper available for making notebooks 
is 75,000. Each sheet makes 8 pages of a notebook. Each notebook contains 
200 pages. How many notebooks can be made from the paper available? 

Solution : Each sheet makes 8 pages. 
Hence, 75,000 sheets make 8 × 75,000 pages, 

Now, 75000 
× 8 
600000 

Thus, 6,00,000 pages are available for making notebooks. 
Now, 200 pages make 1 notebook. 
Hence, 6,00,000 pages make 6,00,000 ÷ 200 notebooks. 
3000 
Now, 200 600000

. 


 600 
0000 The answer is 3,000 notebooks.

1.3.1 Estimation 
News 
1. India drew with Pakistan in a hockey match watched by 51,000 spectators 
in the stadium and 40 million television viewers world wide. 
2. Approximately, 2000 people were killed and more than 50000 injured in a 
cyclonic storm in coastal areas of India and Bangladesh. 
3. Over 13 million passengers are carried over 63,000 kilometre route of 
railway track every day. 
Can we say that there were exactly as many people as the numbers quoted 
in these news items? For example, 
In (1), were there exactly 51,000 spectators in the stadium? or did exactly 
40 million viewers watched the match on television? 
Obviously, not. The word approximately itself 
shows that the number of people were near about these 
numbers. Clearly, 51,000 could be 50,800 or 51,300 
but not 70,000. Similarly, 40 million implies much 
more than 39 million but quite less than 41 million 
but certainly not 50 million. 


17 

MATHEMATICS 


The quantities given in the examples above are not exact counts, but are 
estimates to give an idea of the quantity. 
Discuss what each of these can suggest. 

Where do we approximate? Imagine a big celebration at your home. The first 
thing you do is to find out roughly how many guests may visit you. Can you get an 
idea of the exact number of visitors? It is practically impossible. 

The finance minister of the country presents a budget annually. The minister provides 
for certain amount under the head Education. Can the amount be absolutely accurate? 
It can only be a reasonably good estimate of the expenditure the country needs for 
education during the year. 

Think about the situations where we need to have the exact numbers and compare 
them with situations where you can do with only an approximately estimated number. 
Give three examples of each of such situations. 

1.3.2 Estimating to the nearest tens by rounding off 
Look at the following : 


(a) Find which flags are closer to 260. 
(b) Find the flags which are closer to 270. 
Locate the numbers 10,17 and 20 on your ruler. Is 17 nearer to 10 or 20? The 
gap between 17 and 20 is smaller when compared to the gap between 17 and 10. 


So, we round off 17 as 20, correct to the nearest tens. 
Now consider 12, which also lies between 10 and 20. However, 12 is 

closer to 10 than to 20. So, we round off 12 to 10, correct to the nearest tens. 
How would you round off 76 to the nearest tens? Is it not 80? 
We see that the numbers 1,2,3 and 4 are nearer to 0 than to 10. So, we 

round off 1, 2, 3 and 4 as 0. Number 6, 7, 8, 9 are nearer to 10, so, we round 
them off as 10. Number 5 is equidistant from both 0 and 10; it is a common 
practice to round it off as 10. 

18 


KNOWING OUR NUMBERS 

Round these numbers to the nearest tens.

64 59 99 215 1453 2936 
1.3.3 Estimating to the nearest hundreds by rounding off 
Is 410 nearer to 400 or to 500? 
410 is closer to 400, so it is rounded off to 400, correct to the nearest 

hundred. 
889 lies between 800 and 900. 
It is nearer to 900, so it is rounded off as 900 correct to nearest hundred. 
Numbers 1 to 49 are closer to 0 than to 100, and so are rounded off to 0. 
Numbers 51 to 99 are closer to 100 than to 0, and so are rounded off to 100. 

Number 50 is equidistant from 0 and 100 both. It is a common practice to round it off 
as 100. 
Check if the following rounding off is correct or not : 

841 800; 9537 9500; 49730 49700; 
2546 2500; 286 200; 5750 5800; 
168 200; 149 100; 9870 9800. 

Correct those which are wrong. 

1.3.4 Estimating to the nearest thousands by rounding off 
We know that numbers 1 to 499 are nearer to 0 than to 1000, so these numbers are 
rounded off as 0. 

The numbers 501 to 999 are nearer to 1000 than 0 so they are rounded off as 
1000. 

Number 500 is also rounded off as 1000. 

Check if the following rounding off is correct or not : 

2573 3000; 53552 53000; 

6404 6000; 65437 65000; 

7805 7000; 3499 4000. 

Correct those which are wrong.

1.3.5 Estimating outcomes of number situations 
How do we add numbers? We add numbers by following the algorithm (i.e. the 
given method) systematically. We write the numbers taking care that the digits in the 
same place (ones, tens, hundreds etc.) are in the same column. For example, 

3946 + 6579 + 2050 is written as  
Th H T O 
3 9 4 6 
6 5 7 9 
+ 2 0 5 0 

We add the column of ones and if necessary carry forward the appropriate 
number to the tens place as would be in this case. We then add the tens 
column and this goes on. Complete the rest of the sum yourself. This 
procedure takes time. 

There are many situations where we need to find answers more quickly. 
For example, when you go to a fair or the market, you find a variety of attractive 
things which you want to buy. You need to quickly decide what you can buy. 
So, you need to estimate the amount you need. It is the sum of the prices of 
things you want to buy. 

A trader is to receive money from two sources. The money he is to receive 
is Rs 13,569 from one source and Rs 26,785 from another. He has to pay 
Rs 37,000 to someone else by the evening. He rounds off the numbers to their 
nearest thousands and quickly works out the rough answer. He is happy that 
he has enough money. 

Do you think he would have enough money? Can you tell without doing 
the exact addition/subtraction? 

Sheila and Mohan have to plan their monthly expenditure. They know 
their monthly expenses on transport, on school requirements, on groceries, 

20 


KNOWING OUR NUMBERS 

on milk, and on clothes and also on other regular 
expenses. This month they have to go for visiting 
and buying gifts. They estimate the amount they 
would spend on all this and then add to see, if what 
they have, would be enough. 


Would they round off to thousands as the 
trader did? 

Think and discuss five more situations where we have to estimate sums or 
remainders. 

Did we use rounding off to the same place in all these? 

There are no rigid rules when you want to estimate the outcomes of numbers. 
The procedure depends on the degree of accuracy required and how quickly 
the estimate is needed. The most important thing is, how sensible the guessed 
answer would be. 

1.3.6 To estimate sum or difference 
As we have seen above we can round off a number to any place. The trader 
rounded off the amounts to the nearest thousands and was satisfied that he had 
enough. So, when you estimate any sum or difference, you should have an idea 
of why you need to round off and therefore the place to which you would round 
off. Look at the following examples. 

Example 5 : Estimate: 5,290 + 17,986. 
Solution : You find 17,986 > 5,290. 

Round off to thousands. 

17,986 is rounds off to 18,000 

+5,290 is rounds off to + 5,000 

Estimated sum = 23,000 

Does the method work? You may attempt to find the actual answer and 
verify if the estimate is reasonable. 
Example 6 : Estimate: 5,673  436. 

Solution : To begin with we round off to thousands. (Why?) 

5,673 rounds off to 6,000 
 436 rounds off to  0 
Estimated difference = 6,000 

This is not a reasonable estimate. Why is this not reasonable? 

21 

MATHEMATICS 


To get a closer estimate, let us try rounding each number to hundreds. 
5,673 rounds off to 5,700 

 436 rounds off to  400 
Estimated difference = 5,300 
This is a better and more meaningful estimate. 
1.3.7 To estimate products 
How do we estimate a product? 
What is the estimate for 19 × 78? 
It is obvious that the product is less than 2000. Why? 

If we approximate 19 to the nearest tens, we get 20 and then approximate 78 
to nearest tens, we get 80 and 20 × 80 = 1600 
Look at 63 × 182 

If we approximate both to the nearest hundreds we 
get 100 × 200 = 20,000. This is much larger than the 
actual product. So, what do we do? To get a more 
reasonable estimate, we try rounding off 63 to the 
nearest 10, i.e. 60, and also 182 to the nearest ten, i.e. 

180. We get 60 × 180 or 10,800. This is a good 
estimate, but is not quick enough. 
If we now try approximating 63 to 60 and 182 to 
the nearest hundred, i.e. 200, we get 60 × 200, and this 
number 12,000 is a quick as well as good estimate of 
the product. 

The general rule that we can make is, therefore, Round off each factor to its 
greatest place, then multiply the rounded off factors. Thus, in the above 
example, we rounded off 63 to tens and 182 to hundreds. 

Now, estimate 81 × 479 using this rule : 
479 is rounded off to 500 (rounding off to hundreds), 
and 81 is rounded off to 80 (rounding off to tens). 
The estimated product = 500 × 80 = 40,000 
An important use of estimates for you will be to check your answers. 


Suppose, you have done the multiplication 37 × 1889, but 
are not sure about your answer. A quick and reasonable estimate 
of the product will be 40 × 2000 i.e. 80,000. If your answer 
is close to 80,000, it is probably right. On the other hand, if 
it is close to 8000 or 8,00,000, something is surely wrong in 
your multiplication. 

22 

Same general rule may be followed by addition and 
subtraction of two or more numbers. 

Estimate the 
following products : 
(a) 87 × 313 
(b) 9 × 795 
(c) 898 × 785 
(d) 958 × 387 
Make five more 
such problems and 
solve them.

1.4 Using Brackets 
Suman bought 6 notebooks from the market and the cost was Rs 10 per notebook. 
Her sister Sama also bought 7 notebooks of the same type. Find the total money 
they paid. 

Seema calculated the Meera calculated the

6 × 10 + 7 × 10 6 + 7 =13 
= 60 + 70

1. Write the expressions for each of the following using brackets. 
(a) Four multiplied by the sum of nine and two. 
(b) Divide the difference of eighteen and six by four. 
(c) Forty five divided by three times the sum of three and two. 
2. Write three different situations for (5 + 8) × 6. 
(One such situation is : Sohani and Reeta work for 6 days; Sohani 
works 5 hours a day and Reeta 8 hours a day. How many hours do 
both of them work in a week?) 
3. Write five situations for the following where brackets would be 
necessary. (a) 7(8  3) (b) (7 + 2) (10  3) 

MATHEMATICS 


You can see that Seemas and Meeras ways to get the answer are a bit different. 

But both give the correct result. Why? 
Seema says, what Meera has done is 7 + 6 × 10. 
Appu points out that 7 + 6 × 10 = 7 + 60 = 67. Thus, this is not what Meera 

had done. All the three students are confused. 

To avoid confusion in such cases we may use brackets. We can pack the numbers 
6 and 7 together using a bracket, indicating that the pack is to be treated as a single 
number. Thus, the answer is found by (6 + 7) × 10 = 13 × 10. 

This is what Meera did. She first added 6 and 7 and then multiplied the sum 
by 10. 

This clearly tells us : First, turn everything inside the brackets ( ) into a 
single number and then do the operation outside which in this case is to 
multiply by 10. 

1.4.1 Expanding brackets 
Now, observe how use of brackets allows us to follow our procedure 
systematically. Do you think that it will be easy to keep a track of what steps we 
have to follow without using brackets? 

(i) 7 × 109 = 7 × (100 + 9) = 7 × 100 + 7 × 9 = 700 + 63 = 763 
(ii)102 × 103 = (100 + 2) × (100 + 3) = (100 + 2) × 100 + (100 + 2) × 3 
= 100 × 100 + 2 × 100 + 100 × 3 + 2 × 3 
= 10,000 + 200 + 300 + 6 = 10,000 + 500 + 6 
= 10,506 

(iii) 17 × 109 = (10 + 7) × 109 = 10 × 109 + 7 × 109 
= 10 × (100 + 9) + 7 × (100 + 9) 
= 10 × 100 + 10 × 9 + 7 × 100 + 7 × 9 
= 1000 + 90 + 700 + 63 = 1,790 + 63 
= 1,853 

1.5 Roman Numerals 
We have been using the Hindu-Arabic numeral system so far. This 
is not the only system available. One of the early systems of 
writing numerals is the system of Roman numerals. This system 
is still used in many places.

For example, we can see the use of Roman numerals in clocks; it 
is also used for classes in the school time table etc. 
Find three other examples, where Roman numerals are used.

The Roman numerals 


KNOWING OUR NUMBERS 

I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X 
denote 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and 10 respectively. This is followed by XI for 11, XII 

for 12,... till XX for 20. Some more Roman numerals are : 
IVXLC D M 
1 5 10 50 100 500 1000 
The rules for the system are : 

(a) If a symbol is repeated, its value is added as many times as it occurs: 
i.e. II is equal 2, XX is 20 and XXX is 30. 
(b) A symbol is not repeated more than three times. But the symbols V, L and D 
are never repeated. 
(c) If a symbol of smaller value is written to the right of a symbol of greater 
value, its value gets added to the value of greater symbol. 
VI = 5 + 1 = 6, XII = 10 + 2 = 12 
and LXV = 50 + 10 + 5 = 65 

(d) If a symbol of smaller value is written to the left of a symbol of greater 
value, its value is subtracted from the value of the greater symbol. 
IV = 5  1 = 4, IX = 10  1 = 9 
XL= 50  10 = 40, XC = 100  10 = 90 

(e) The symbols V, L and D are never written to the left of a symbol of greater 
value, i.e. V, L and D are never subtracted. 
The symbol I can be subtracted from V and X only. 
The symbol X can be subtracted from L, M and C only. 

Following these rules we get, 
1= I 10 = X 100 = C 
2=II 20 = XX 
3= III 30 = XXX 
4=IV 40 = XL 
5=V 50 = L 
6=VI 60 = LX 
7= VII 70 = LXX 
8 = VIII 80 = LXXX 
9=IX 90 = XC

MATHEMATICS 


Example 7 : Write in Roman Numerals (a) 69 (b) 98. 
Solution : (a) 69 = 60 + 9 (b) 98 = 90 + 8 
= (50 + 10) + 9 = (100  10) + 8 
= LX + IX = XC + VIII 
= LX IX = XCVIII 

What have we discussed? 

1. Given two numbers, one with more digits is the greater number. If the number of 
digits in two given numbers is the same, that number is larger, which has a greater 
leftmost digit. If this digit also happens to be the same, we look at the next digit and 
so on. 
2. In forming numbers from given digits, we should be careful to see if the conditions 
under which the numbers are to be formed are satisfied. Thus, to form the greatest 
four digit number from 7, 8, 3, 5 without repeating a single digit, we need to use all 
four digits, the greatest number can have only 8 as the leftmost digit. 
3. The smallest four digit number is 1000 (one thousand). It follows the largest three 
digit number 999. Similarly, the smallest five digit number is 10,000. It is ten thousand 
and follows the largest four digit number 9999. 
Further, the smallest six digit number is 100,000. It is one lakh and follows the largest 
five digit number 99,999. This carries on for higher digit numbers in a similar manner. 

4. Use of commas helps in reading and writing large numbers. In the Indian system of 
numeration we have commas after 3 digits starting from the right and thereafter every 
2 digits. The commas after 3, 5 and 7 digits separate thousand, lakh and crore 
respectively. In the International system of numeration commas are placed after every 
3 digits starting from the right. The commas after 3 and 6 digits separate thousand 
and million respectively. 
5. Large numbers are needed in many places in daily life. For example, for giving number 
of students in a school, number of people in a village or town, money paid or received 
in large transactions (paying and selling), in measuring large distances say betwen 
various cities in a country or in the world and so on. 
6. Remember kilo shows 1000 times larger, Centi shows 100 times smaller and milli 
shows 1000 times smaller, thus, 1 kilometre = 1000 metres, 1 metre = 100 centimetres 
or 1000 millimetres etc. 
7. There are a number of situations in which we do not need the exact quantity but need 
only a reasonable guess or an estimate. For example, while stating how many spectators 
watched a particular international hockey match, we state the approximate number, 
say 51,000, we do not need to state the exact number.

KNOWING OUR NUMBERS 

8. Estimation involves approximating a quantity to an accuracy required. Thus, 4117 
may be approximated to 4100 or to 4000, i.e. to the nearest hundred or to the 
nearest thousand depending on our need. 
9. In number of situations, we have to estimate the outcome of number operations. This 
is done by rounding off the numbers involved and getting a quick, rough answer. 
10. Estimating the outcome of number operations is useful in checking answers. 
11. Use of brackets allows us to avoid confusion in the problems where we need to 
carry out more than one number operation. 
12. We use the Hindu-Arabic system of numerals. Another system of writing numerals is 
the Roman system.
