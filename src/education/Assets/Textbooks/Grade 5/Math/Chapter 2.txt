2.1 Introduction 
Chapter 2 
Whole Numbers 
As we know, we use 1, 2, 3, 4,... when we begin to count. They come naturally 
when we start counting. Hence, mathematicians call the counting numbers as 
Natural numbers. 

Predecessor and successor 

Given any natural number, you can add 1 to 
that number and get the next number i.e. you 
get its successor. 

The successor of 16 is 16 + 1 = 17, 
that of 19 is 19 +1 = 20 and so on. 

The number 16 comes before 17, we 
say that the predecessor of 17 is 17–1=16, 
the predecessor of 20 is 20 – 1 = 19, and 
so on. 

The number 3 has a predecessor and a 
successor. What about 2? The successor is 
3 and the predecessor is 1. Does 1 have both 

a successor and a predecessor? 

We can count the number of children in our school; we 
can also count the number of people in a city; we can count 
the number of people in India. The number of people in the 
whole world can also be counted. We may not be able to 
count the number of stars in the sky or the number of hair 
on our heads but if we are able, there would be a number for 
them also. We can then add one more to such a number and 

1. Write the predecessor 
and successor of 
19; 1997; 12000; 
49; 100000. 
2. Is there any natural 
number that has no 
predecessor? 
3. Is there any natural 
number which has no 
successor? Is there a 
last natural number? 

WHOLE NUMBERS 

get a larger number. In that case we can even write the number of hair on two 
heads taken together. 

It is now perhaps obvious that there is no largest number. Apart from these 
questions shared above, there are many others that can come to our mind 
when we work with natural numbers. You can think of a few such questions 
and discuss them with your friends. You may not clearly know the answers to 
many of them ! 

2.2 Whole Numbers 
We have seen that the number 1 has no predecessor in natural numbers. To the 
collection of natural numbers we add zero as the predecessor for 1. 

The natural numbers along with zero form the collection of whole 
numbers. 
In your previous classes you have learnt to 
perform all the basic operations like addition, 
subtraction, multiplication and division on 
numbers. You also know how to apply them to 
problems. Let us try them on a number line. 
Before we proceed, let us find out what a 
number line is! 
1. Are all natural numbers 
also whole numbers? 
2. Are all whole numbers 
also natural numbers? 
3. Which is the greatest 
whole number? 
2.3 The Number Line 
Draw a line. Mark a point on it. Label it 0. Mark a second point to the right of 

0. Label it 1. 
The distance between these points labelled as 0 and 1 is called unit distance. 
On this line, mark a point to the right of 1 and at unit distance from 1 and 
label it 2. In this way go on labelling points at unit distances as 3, 4, 5,... on 
the line. You can go to any whole number on the right in this manner. 

This is a number line for the whole numbers. 


What is the distance between the points 2 and 4? Certainly, it is 2 units. 
Can you tell the distance between the points 2 and 6, between 2 and 7? 

On the number line you will see that the number 7 is on the right of 4. 
This number 7 is greater than 4, i.e. 7 > 4. The number 8 lies on the right of 6 

29 

MATHEMATICS 

and 8 > 6. These observations help us to say that, out of any two whole 
numbers, the number on the right of the other number is the greater number. 
We can also say that whole number on left is the smaller number. 

For example, 4 < 9; 4 is on the left of 9. Similarly, 12 > 5; 12 is to the 
right of 5. 

What can you say about 10 and 20? 

Mark 30, 12, 18 on the number line. Which number is at the farthest left? 
Can you say from 1005 and 9756, which number would be on the right 
relative to the other number.

 Place the successor of 12 and the predecessor of 7 on the number line. 

Addition on the number line 

Addition of whole numbers can be shown on the number line. Let us see the 
addition of 3 and 4. 


Start from 3. Since we add 4 to this number so we 
make 4 jumps to the right; from 3 to 4, 4 to 5, 5 to 6 and 6 
to 7 as shown above. The tip of the last arrow in the fourth 
jump is at 7. 

The sum of 3 and 4 is 7, i.e. 3 + 4 = 7. 

Subtraction on the number line 

The subtraction of two whole numbers can also be shown on the number line. 
Let us find 7 – 5. 

Find 4 + 5; 
2 + 6; 3 + 5 
and 1+6 
using the 
number line. 
Start from 7. Since 5 is being subtracted, so move 
towards left with 1 jump of 1 unit. Make 5 such jumps. We 
reach the point 2. We get 7 – 5 = 2. 

Multiplication on the number line 

We now see the multiplication of whole numbers on the 
number line. 

Let us find 3 × 4. 

Find 8 – 3; 
6 – 2; 9 – 6 
using the 
number line. 
30 

WHOLE NUMBERS 

Find 2 × 6; 
3 × 3; 4 × 2 
using the 
number line. 
Start from 0, move 3 units at a time to the right, make 
such 4 moves. Where do you reach? You will reach 12. 
So, we say, 3 × 4 = 12.

7. In each of the following pairs of numbers, state which whole number is on the left of 
the other number on the number line. Also write them with the appropriate sign (>, <) 
between them. 
(a) 530, 503 (b) 370, 307 (c) 98765, 56789 (d) 9830415, 10023001

(m) The successor of a two digit number is always a two digit number. 
2.4 Properties of Whole Numbers 
When we look into various operations on numbers closely, we notice several 
properties of whole numbers. These properties help us to understand the 
numbers better. Moreover, they make calculations under certain operations 
very simple. 

31 

MATHEMATICS 

DoThis
Let each one of you in the class take any two whole numbers and add them. 
Is the result always a whole number? 
Your additions may be like this: 


7 + 8 = 15, a whole number 
5 + 5 = 10, a whole number 
0 + 15 = 15, a whole number 
. + . = … 
. + . = … 

Try with five other pairs of numbers. Is the sum always a whole number? 

Did you find a pair of whole numbers whose sum is not a whole number? 
Hence, we say that sum of any two whole numbers is a whole number i.e. the 
collection of whole numbers is closed under addition. This property is known 
as the closure property for addition of whole numbers. 

Are the whole numbers closed under multiplication too? How will you 
check it? 

Your multiplications may be like this : 

7 × 8 = 56, a whole number 
5 × 5 = 25, a whole number 
0 × 15 = 0, a whole number 
. × . = … 
. × . = … 

The multiplication of two whole numbers is also found to be a whole 
number again. We say that the system of whole numbers is closed under 
multiplication. 

Closure property : Whole numbers are closed under addition and also 
under multiplication. 

Think, discuss and write 

1. The whole numbers 
are not closed under 
subtraction. Why? 
Your subtractions may 
be like this : 
6 – 2 = 4, a whole number 
7 – 8 = ?, not a whole number 
5 – 4 = 1, a whole number 
3 – 9 = ?, not a whole number 

Take a few examples of your own and confirm. 

32 


WHOLE NUMBERS 

2. Are the whole numbers closed under division? No. Observe this table : 
8 ÷ 4 = 2, a whole number 
5 ÷ 7 = 
5 
, not a whole number7 
12 ÷ 3 = 4, a whole number 
6 ÷ 5 = 
6 
, not a whole number5 

Justify it by taking a few more examples of your own. 

After how many moves did we 
reach 0? In four moves. 
So, we write 8 ÷ 2 = 4. 
Using this, find 24 ÷ 8; 16 ÷ 4. 
In every move we get 2 again ! 
Will this ever stop? No. 
We say 2 ÷ 0 is not defined. 
Division by zero 
Division by a number means subtracting that number repeatedly. 
Let us find 8 ÷ 2. 
8 
– 2 ........ 1 
6 
– 2 ........ 2 
4 
– 2 ........ 3 
2 
– 2 ........ 4 
0 
Let us now try 2 ÷ 0. 
2 
– 0 ........ 1 
2 
– 0 ........ 2 
2 
– 0 ........ 3 
2 
– 0 ........ 4 
2 
Subtract 2 again and again from 8. 
33 

MATHEMATICS 

Let us try 7 ÷ 0 
7 
– 0 ........ 1 
7 
– 0 ........ 2 
7 
– 0 ........ 3 
7 
Division of a whole number by 0 is not defined. 
Again, we never get 0 at any 
stage of subtraction. 
We say 7 ÷ 0 is not defined. 
Check it for 5 ÷ 0, 16 ÷ 0. 
Commutativity of addition and multiplication 

What do the following number line diagrams say? 


In both the cases we reach 5. So, 3 + 2 is same as 2 + 3. 
Similarly, 5 + 3 is same as 3 + 5. 


Try it for 4 + 6 and 6 + 4. 

Is this true when any two whole numbers are added? 
Check it. You will not get any pair of whole numbers for 
which the sum is different when the order of addition is 
changed. 


You can add two whole numbers in any order. 

We say that addition is commutative for whole numbers. This property is 
known as commutativity for addition. 

34 


WHOLE NUMBERS 

Discuss with your friends 

You have a small party at home. 
You want to arrange 6 rows of 
chairs with 8 chairs in each row 
for the visitors. The number of 
chairs you will need is 6 × 8. You 
find that the room is not wide 
enough to accommodate rows of 
8 chairs. You decide to have 8 rows of chairs with 6 chairs in each row. How 
many chairs do you require now? Will you require more number of chairs? 


Is there a commutative property of multiplication? 

Multiply numbers 4 and 5 in different orders. 

You will observe that 4 × 5 = 5 × 4. 
Is it true for the numbers 3 and 6; 5 and 7 also? 
You can multiply two whole numbers in any order. 
We say multiplication is commutative for whole numbers. 

Thus, addition and multiplication are commutative for whole numbers. 

Verify : 

(i) Subtraction in not commutative for whole numbers. Use at least three 
different pairs of numbers to verify it. 
(ii) Is (6 ÷ 3)same as (3 ÷ 6)? 
Justify it by taking few more combinations of whole numbers. 
Associativity of addition and multiplication 

Observe the following diagrams : 

(a) (2 + 3) + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9 
(b) 2 + (3 + 4) = 2 + 7 = 9 
In (a) above, you can add 2 and 3 first and then add 4 to the sum and 
in (b) you can add 3 and 4 first and then add 2 to the sum. 

Are not the results same? 

We also have, (5 + 7) + 3 = 12 + 3 = 15 and 5 + (7 + 3) = 5 + 10 = 15. 

So, (5 + 7) + 3 = 5 + (7 + 3) 

35 

MATHEMATICS 

This is associativity of addition for whole numbers. 
Check it for the numbers 2, 8 and 6. 
Example 1 : Add the numbers 234, 197 and 103. 

Notice how we 
grouped the numbers for 
convenience of adding. 
Solution : 234 + 197 + 103 = 234 + (197 + 103) 
= 234 + 300 = 534

Play this game 

You and your friend can play this. 

You call a number from 1 to 10. Your friend now adds to this number any 
number from 1 to 10. Then it is your turn. You both play alternately. The 
winner is the one who reaches 100 first. If you always want to win the game, 
what will be your strategy or plan? 


Observe the multiplication fact illustrated by the following diagrams 

(Fig 2.1). 

Count the number 
of dots in Fig 2.1 (a) 
and Fig 2.1 (b). What 

(a) (b)
do you get? The 

Fig 2.1

number of dots is the 

same. In Fig 2.1 (a), we have 2 × 3 dots in each box. So, the total number 
of dots is (2 × 3) × 4 = 24. 

In Fig 2.1 (b), each box has 3 × 4 dots, so in all there are 2 × (3 × 4) = 24 dots. 
Thus, (2 × 3) × 4 = 2 × (3 × 4). Similarly, you can see that (3 × 5) × 4 = 3 × (5 × 4) 

Try this for (5 × 6) × 2 and 5 × (6 × 2); (3 × 6) × 4 and 3 × (6 × 4). 

This is associative property for multiplication of whole numbers. 

36 


WHOLE NUMBERS 

Think on and find : 
Which is easier and why? 

(a)(6 × 5) × 3 or 6 × (5 × 3) 
(b)(9 × 4) × 25 or 9 × (4 × 25) 
Example 2 : Find 14 + 17 + 6 in two ways. 

Solution : (14 + 17) + 6 = 31 + 6 = 37, 
14 + 17 + 6 = 14 + 6 + 17 = (14 + 6) + 17 = 20 + 17 = 37 
Here, you have used a combination of associative and commutative properties 
for addition. 
Do you think using the commutative and the associative property has made 
the calculation easier? 

The associative property of 
multiplication is very useful in the 
following types of sums. 

Example 3 : Find 12 × 35. 
Solution : 12 × 35 = (6 × 2) × 35 = 6 × (2 × 35) = 6 × 70 = 420. 
In the above example, we have used associativity to get the advantage of 
multiplying the smallest even number by a multiple of 5. 


Find : 7 + 18 + 13; 16 + 12 + 4 
Example 4 : Find 8 × 1769 × 125 
Solution : 8 × 1769 × 125 = 8 × 125 × 1769 
(What property do you use here?) 
= (8 × 125) × 1769 
= 1000 × 1769 = 17,69,000. 

Find : 
25 × 8358 × 4 ; 
625 × 3759 × 8 
Think, discuss and write 

Is (16 ÷ 4) ÷ 2 = 16 ÷ (4 ÷ 2)? 
Is there an associative property for division? No. 
Discuss with your friends. Think of (28 ÷ 14) ÷ 2 and 28 ÷ (14 ÷ 2).

Distributivity of multiplication over addition 

Take a graph paper of size 6 cm by 8 cm having squares of size 1 cm × 1 cm. 

37 

MATHEMATICS 

How many squares do you have in all? 


Is the number 6 × 8? 
Now cut the sheet into two pieces of sizes 6 cm by 5 cm and 6 cm by 3 cm, as 
shown in the figure. 


Number of squares : Is it 6 × 5? Number of squares : Is it 6 × 3? 
In all, how many squares are there in both the pieces? 
Is it (6 × 5) + (6 × 3)? Does it mean that 6 × 8 = (6 × 5) + (6 × 3)? 
But, 6 × 8 = 6 × (5 + 3) 
Does this show that 6 × (5 + 3) = (6 × 5) + (6 × 3)? 
Similarly, you will find that 2 × (3 + 5) = (2 × 3) + (2 × 5) 
This is known as distributivity of multiplication over addition. 
find using distributivity : 4 × (5 + 8) ; 6 × (7 + 9); 7 × (11 + 9). 

Think, discuss and write 

Observe the following multiplication and discuss whether we use here the

Example 5 : The school canteen charges Rs 20 for lunch and Rs 4 for milk for 
each day. How much money do you spend in 5 days on these things? 
Solution : This can be found by two methods. 
Method 1 : Find the amount for lunch for 5 days. 
Find the amount for milk for 5 days. 
Then add i.e. 
Cost of lunch = 5 × 20 = Rs 100 
Cost of milk = 5 × 4 = Rs 20 
Total cost = Rs (100 + 20) = Rs 120 
Method 2 : Find the total amount for one day. 
Then multiply it by 5 i.e. 
Cost of (lunch + milk) for one day = Rs (20 + 4) 
Cost for 5 days = Rs 5 × (20 + 4) = Rs (5 × 24) 
= Rs 120. 
The example shows that 
5 × (20 + 4) = (5 × 20) + (5 × 4) 
This is the principle of distributivity of multiplication over addition. 


Example 6 : Find 12 × 35 using distributivity. 

Solution : 12 × 35 = 12 × (30 + 5) 

= 12 × 30 +12 × 5 

= 360 + 60 = 420 

Example 7 : Simplify: 126 × 55 + 126 × 45 

Find 15 × 68; 17 × 23; 
69 × 78 + 22 × 69 using 
distributive property. 
Solution : 126 × 55 + 126 × 45 = 126 × (55 + 45)

 = 126 × 100

 = 12600. 

Identity (for addition and multiplication) 

How is the collection of whole numbers different 
from the collection of natural numbers? It is just 
the presence of 'zero' in the collection of whole 
numbers. This number 'zero' has a special role in 
addition. The following table will help you guess 
the role. 

When you add zero to any whole number what 
is the result? 

7 + 0 = 7 
5 + 0 = 5 
0 + 15 = 15 
0 + 26 = 26 
0 + ..... = ..... 

39 

MATHEMATICS 


It is the same whole number again! Zero is called an identity for addition 

of whole numbers or additive identity for whole numbers. 
Zero has a special role in multiplication too. Any number when multiplied 

by zero becomes zero! 

For example, observe the pattern : 

5 × 6 = 30 

5 × 5 = 25 


Observe how the products decrease. 
5 × 4 = 20 

Do you see a pattern? 
5 × 3 = 15 

Can you guess the last step? 
5 × 2 = ... 

Is this pattern true for other whole numbers also? 
5 × 1 = ... 

Try doing this with two different whole numbers. 
5 × 0 = ? 

You came across an additive identity for whole 
numbers. A number remains unchanged when added 
to zero. Similar is the case for a multiplicative 
identity for whole numbers. Observe this table. 

You are right. 1 is the identity for multiplication 
of whole numbers or multiplicative identity for 

7 × 1 = 7 
5 × 1 = 5 
1 × 12 = 12 
1 × 100 = 100 
1 × ...... = ......

2.5 Patterns in Whole Numbers 
We shall try to arrange numbers in elementary shapes made up of dots. The 
shapes we take are (1) a line (2) a rectangle (3) a square and (4) a triangle. 
Every number should be arranged in one of these shapes. No other shape is 
allowed. 

Every number can be arranged as a line; 
The number 2 is shown as 
... 
The number 3 is shown as 
..... 
and so on. 

..

..

Some numbers can be shown also as rectangles. 
For example, 
The number 6 can be shown as 
..... 


a rectangle. Note there are 2 

..... 


rows and 3 columns. 

..

Some numbers like 4 or 9 can also be arranged as squares; 


Some numbers can also be arranged as triangles. 
For example, 

..


Note that the triangle should have its two sides equal. The number of 
dots in the rows starting from the bottom row should be like 4, 3, 2, 1. 
The top row should always have 1 dot.

Patterns Observation 

Observation of patterns can guide you in simplifying processes. Study the 
following: 

(a)117 + 9 = 117 + 10 – 1 = 127 – 1 = 126 
(b)117 – 9 = 117 – 10 + 1 = 107 + 1 = 108 

WHOLE NUMBERS 

(c)117 + 99 = 117 + 100 – 1 = 217 – 1 = 216 
(d)117 – 99 = 117 – 100 + 1 = 17 + 1 = 18 
Does this pattern help you to add or subtract numbers of the form 
9, 99, 999,…? 
Here is one more pattern : 

(a) 84 × 9 = 84 × (10 – 1) (b) 84 × 99 = 84 × (100 – 1) 
(c) 84 × 999 = 84 × (1000 – 1) 
Do you find a shortcut to multiply a number by numbers of the form 
9, 99, 999,…? 

Such shortcuts enable you to do sums verbally.

3. If the product of two whole numbers is 1, can we say that one or both of them will be 
1? Justify through examples. 
4. Find using distributive property : 
(a) 728 × 101 (b) 5437 × 1001 (c) 824 × 25 (d) 4275 × 125 (e) 504 × 35 
5. Study the pattern : 
1 × 8 + 1 = 9 1234 × 8 + 4 = 9876 
12 × 8 + 2= 98 12345 × 8 + 5= 98765 
123 × 8 + 3 = 987 
Write the next two steps. Can you say how the pattern works? 
(Hint: 12345 = 11111 + 1111 + 111 + 11 + 1). 
What have we discussed? 

1. The numbers 1, 2, 3,... which we use for counting are known as natural numbers. 
2. If you add 1 to a natural number, we get its successor. If you subtract 1 from a natural 
number, you get its predecessor. 
3. Every natural number has a successor. Every natural number except 1 has a predecessor. 
4. If we add the number zero to the collection of natural numbers, we get the collection of 
whole numbers. Thus, the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3,... form the collection of whole numbers. 
5. Every whole number has a successor. Every whole number except zero has a 
predecessor. 
6. All natural numbers are whole numbers, but all whole numbers are not natural 
numbers. 
7. We take a line, mark a point on it and label it 0. We then mark out points to the right 
of 0, at equal intervals. Label them as 1, 2, 3,.... Thus, we have a number line with the 
whole numbers represented on it. We can easily perform the number operations of 
addition, subtraction and multiplication on the number line. 
8. Addition corresponds to moving to the right on the number line, whereas subtraction 
corresponds to moving to the left. Multiplication corresponds to making jumps of 
equal distance starting from zero. 
9. Adding two whole numbers always gives a whole number. Similarly, multiplying two 
whole numbers always gives a whole number. We say that whole numbers are closed 
under addition and also under multiplication. However, whole numbers are not closed 
under subtraction and under division. 
10. Division by zero is not defined.

WHOLE NUMBERS 

11. Zero is the identity for addition of whole numbers. The whole number 1 is the identity 
for multiplication of whole numbers. 
12. You can add two whole numbers in any order.You can multiply two whole numbers in 
any order. We say that addition and multiplication are commutative for whole numbers. 
13. Addition and multiplication, both, are associative for whole numbers. 
14. Multiplication is distributive over addition for whole numbers. 
15. Commutativity, associativity and distributivity properties of whole numbers are useful 
in simplifying calculations and we use them without being aware of them. 
16. Patterns with numbers are not only interesting, but are useful especially for verbal 
calculations and help us to understand properties of numbers better.
