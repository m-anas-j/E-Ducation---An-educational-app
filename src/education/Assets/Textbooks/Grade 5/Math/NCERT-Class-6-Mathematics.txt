1.1 Introduction 
Chapter 1 
Knowing our Numbers 
Counting things is easy for us now. We can count objects in large numbers, 
for example, the number of students in the school, and represent them 
through numerals. We can also communicate large numbers using suitable 
number names. 

It is not as if we always knew how to convey large quantities in conversation 
or through symbols. Many thousands years ago, people knew only small 
numbers. Gradually, they learnt how to handle larger numbers. They also learnt 
how to express large numbers in symbols. All this came through collective 
efforts of human beings. Their path was not easy, they struggled all along the 
way. In fact, the development of whole of Mathematics can be understood 
this way. As human beings progressed, there was greater need for development 
of Mathematics and as a result Mathematics grew further and faster. 

We use numbers and know many things about them. Numbers help us 
count concrete objects. They help us to say which collection of objects 
is bigger and arrange them in order e.g., first, second, etc. Numbers are 
used in many different contexts and in many ways. Think about various 
situations where we use numbers. List five distinct situations in which 
numbers are used. 

We enjoyed working with numbers in our previous classes. We have added, 
subtracted, multiplied and divided them. We also looked for patterns in number 
sequences and done many other interesting things with numbers. In this chapter, 
we shall move forward on such interesting things with a bit of review and 
revision as well. 



MATHEMATICS 

1.2 Comparing Numbers 
As we have done quite a lot of this earlier, let us see if we remember which is 
the greatest among these : 


(i) 92, 392, 4456, 89742 

(ii) 1902, 1920, 9201, 9021, 9210 
So, we know the answers. 
Discuss with your friends, how you find the number that is the greatest. 

Can you instantly find the greatest and the smallest numbers in each row? 
1. 382, 4972, 18, 59785, 750. Ans. 59785 is the greatest and 
18 is the smallest. 
2. 1473, 89423, 100, 5000, 310. Ans. ____________________ 
3. 1834, 75284, 111, 2333, 450 . Ans. ____________________ 
4. 2853, 7691, 9999, 12002, 124. Ans. ____________________ 
Was that easy? Why was it easy? 
We just looked at the number of digits and found the answer. 
The greatest number has the most thousands and the smallest is 
only in hundreds or in tens. 

Make five more problems of this kind and give to your friends 

to solve. 
Now, how do we compare 4875 and 3542? 
This is also not very difficult.These two numbers have the 

same number of digits. They are both in thousands. But the digit 
at the thousands place in 4875 is greater than that in 3542. 
Therefore, 4875 is greater than 3542. 

Find the greatest and the smallest 
numbers. 
(a) 4536, 4892, 4370, 4452. 
(b) 15623, 15073, 15189, 15800. 
(c) 25286, 25245, 25270, 25210. 
(d) 6895, 23787, 24569, 24659. 
Next tell which is greater, 4875 or 
4542? Here too the numbers have the 
same number of digits. Further, the digits 
at the thousands place are same in both. 
What do we do then? We move to the 
next digit, that is to the digit at the 
hundreds place. The digit at the hundreds 
place is greater in 4875 than in 4542. 
Therefore, 4875 is greater than 4542. 


2 


KNOWING OUR NUMBERS 

If the digits at hundreds place are also same in the two numbers, then what 
do we do? 

Compare 4875 and 4889 ; Also compare 4875 and 4879. 

1.2.1 How many numbers can you make? 
Suppose, we have four digits 7, 8, 3, 5. Using these digits we want to make 
different 4-digit numbers such that no digits are repeated in a number. Thus, 
7835 is allowed, but 7735 is not. Make as many 4-digit numbers as you can. 

Which is the greatest number you can get? Which is the smallest number? 
The greatest number is 8753 and the smallest is 3578. 
Think about the arrangement of the digits in both. Can you say how the largest 

number is formed? Write down your procedure. 


1. Use the given digits without repetition and make the greatest and smallest 
4-digit numbers. 
(a) 2, 8, 7, 4 (b) 9, 7, 4, 1 (c) 4, 7, 5, 0 
(d) 1, 7, 6, 2 (e) 5, 4, 0, 3 
(Hint : 0754 is a 3-digit number.) 
2. Now make the greatest and the smallest 4-digit numbers by using any one 
digit twice. 
(a) 3, 8, 7 (b) 9, 0, 5 (c) 0, 4, 9 (d) 8, 5, 1 
(Hint : Think in each case which digit will you use twice.) 
3. Make the greatest and the smallest 4-digit numbers using any four different 
digits with conditions as given. 
(a) Digit 7 is always at Greatest 9

4. Take two digits, say 2 and 3. Make 4-digit numbers using both the digits equal 
number of times. 
Which is the greatest number? 
Which is the smallest number? 
How many different numbers can you make in all? 

Stand in proper order 

1. Who is the tallest? 
2. Who is the shortest? 
(a) Can you arrange them in the increasing order of their heights? 
(b) Can you arrange them in the decreasing order of their heights? 
Ramhari Dolly Mohan Shashi

Rs 2635 Rs 1897 Rs 2854 Rs 1788 Rs 3975 
Which to buy? 

Sohan and Rita went 
to buy an almirah. 
There were many 
almirahs available 
with their price tags. 

(a) Can you arrange their prices in increasing 
order? 
(b) Can you arrange their prices in 
decreasing order? 
Think of five more situations 
where you compare three or 
more quantities. 
Ascending order Ascending order means arrangement from the smallest to the 

greatest. 
Descending order Descending order means arrangement from the greatest to 
the smallest.

KNOWING OUR NUMBERS 

1. Arrange the following numbers in ascending order : 
(a) 847, 9754, 8320, 571 (b) 9801, 25751, 36501, 38802 
2. Arrange the following numbers in descending order : 
(a) 5000, 7500, 85400, 7861 (b) 1971, 45321, 88715, 92547 
Make ten such examples of ascending/descending order and solve them. 
1.2.2 Shifting digits 
Have you thought what fun it would be if the digits in a number could shift 
(move) from one place to the other? 

Think about what would happen to 182. It could become as large as 821 
and as small as 128. Try this with 391 as well. 

Now think about this. Take any 3-digit number and exchange the digit at 
the hundreds place with the digit at the ones place. 

(a) Is the new number greater than the former one? 
(b) Is the new number smaller than the former number? 
Write the numbers formed in both ascending and descending order. 
Before 

7 9 5 
Exchanging the 1st and the 3rd tiles. 

After 

5 9 7 
If you exchange the 1st and the 3rd tiles (i.e. digits), in which case does the 
number become greater? In which case does it become smaller? 
Try this with a 4-digit number. 

1.2.3 Introducing 10,000 

We know that beyond 99 there is no 2-digit number. 99 is the greatest 2-digit 
number. Similarly, the greatest 3-digit number is 999 and the greatest 4-digit 
number is 9999. What shall we get if we add 1 to 9999? 

Look at the pattern : 9 + 1 = 10 = 10 × 1 
99 + 1 = 100 = 10 × 10 
999 + 1 = 1000 = 10 × 100 

We observe that 
Greatest single digit number + 1 = smallest 2-digit number 
Greatest 2-digit number + 1 = smallest 3-digit number 
Greatest 3-digit number + 1 = smallest 4-digit number 

5 

MATHEMATICS 

Should not we then expect that on adding 1 to the greatest 4-digit number, 
we would get the smallest 5-digit number, that is 9999 + 1 = 10000. 
The new number which comes next to 9999 is 10000. It is called 
ten thousand. Further, we expect 10000 = 10 × 1000. 

1.2.4 Revisiting place value 
You have done this quite earlier, and you will certainly remember the expansion 
of a 2-digit number like 78 as 
78 = 70 + 8 = 7 × 10 + 8 
Similarly, you will remember the expansion of a 3-digit number like 278 as 
278 = 200 + 70 + 8 = 2 × 100 + 7 × 10 + 8 

We say, here, 8 is at ones place, 7 is at tens place and 2 at hundreds place. 
Later on we extended this idea to 4-digit numbers. 
For example, the expansion of 5278 is 

5278 = 5000 + 200 + 70 + 8 
= 5 × 1000 + 2 × 100 + 7 × 10 + 8 
Here, 8 is at ones place, 7 is at tens place, 2 is at hundreds place and 5 is at 
thousands place. 
With the number 10000 known to us, we may extend the idea further. We 
may write 5-digit numbers like 
45278 = 4 × 10000 + 5 × 1000 + 2 × 100 + 7 × 10 + 8 

We say that here 8 is at ones place, 7 at tens place, 2 at hundreds place, 
5 at thousands place and 4 at ten thousands place. The number is read as forty 
five thousand, two hundred seventy eight. Can you now write the smallest 
and the greatest 5-digit numbers? 

Read and expand the numbers wherever there are blanks. 
Number Number Name Expansion 
20000 twenty thousand 2 × 10000 
26000 twenty six thousand 2 × 10000 + 6 × 1000 
38400 thirty eight thousand 3 × 10000 + 8 × 1000 
four hundred + 4 × 100 
65740 sixty five thousand 6 × 10000 + 5 × 1000

Write five more 5-digit numbers, read them and expand them. 
1.2.5 Introducing 1,00,000 

Which is the greatest 5-digit number? 
Adding 1 to the greatest 5-digit number, should give the smallest 
6-digit number : 99,999 + 1 = 1,00,000 
This number is named one lakh. One lakh comes next to 99,999. 
10 × 10,000 = 1,00,000 
We may now write 6-digit numbers in the expanded form as 
2,46,853 = 2 × 1,00,000 + 4 × 10,000 + 6 × 1,000 + 
8 × 100 + 5 × 10 +3 × 1 

This number has 3 at ones place, 5 at tens place, 8 at hundreds place, 6 at 
thousands place, 4 at ten thousands place and 2 at lakh place. Its number 
name is two lakh forty six thousand eight hundred fifty three. 

Read and expand the numbers wherever there are blanks.

1.2.6 Larger numbers 
If we add one more to the greatest 6-digit number we get the smallest 7-digit 
number. It is called ten lakh. 

Write down the greatest 6-digit number and the smallest 7-digit number. 
Write the greatest 7-digit number and the smallest 8-digit number. The smallest 


8-digit number is called one crore. 
Complete the pattern : 
9 + 1 =10 
99 + 1 = 100 
999 + 1 = _______ 
9,999 + 1 = _______ 
99,999 + 1 = _______ 
9,99,999 + 1 = _______ 
99,99,999 + 1 = 1,00,00,000 

Remember 
1 hundred = 10 tens 
1 thousand = 10 hundreds 
= 100 tens 
1 lakh = 100 thousands 
= 1000 hundreds 
1 crore = 100 lakhs 
= 10,000 thousands 

We come across large numbers in 
many different situations. 
For example, while the number of 
children in your class would be a 
2-digit number, the number of 
children in your school would be 
a 3 or 4-digit number. 
The number of people in the nearby town would be much larger. 
Is it a 5 or 6 or 7-digit number? 
Do you know the number of people in your state? 
How many digits would that number have? 
What would be the number of grains in a sack full of wheat? A 5-digit number, 
a 6-digit number or more? 
1. What is 10 – 1 =? 
2. What is 100 – 1 =? 
3. What is 10,000 – 1 =? 
4. What is 1,00,000 – 1 =? 
5. What is 1,00,00,000 – 1 =? 
(Hint : Use the said pattern.) 
1. Give five examples where the number of things counted would be more than 
6-digit number. 
2. Starting from the greatest 6-digit number, write the previous five numbers in 
descending order. 
3. Starting from the smallest 8-digit number, write the next five numbers in 
ascending order and read them.

1.2.7 An aid in reading and writing large numbers 
Try reading the following numbers : 
(a) 279453 (b) 5035472 
(c) 152700375 (d) 40350894 

Was it difficult? 
Did you find it difficult to keep track? 
Sometimes it helps to use indicators to read and write large numbers. 

Shagufta uses indicators which help her to read and write large numbers. 
Her indicators are also useful in writing the expansion of numbers. For example, 
she identifies the digits in ones place, tens place and hundreds place in 257 by 
writing them under the tables O, T and H as 

H T O Expansion 
2 5 7 2 × 100 + 5 × 10 + 7 × 1 
Similarly, for 2902, 
Th H T O Expansion 
2 9 0 2 2 × 1000 + 9 × 100 + 0 × 10 + 2 × 1 

One can extend this idea to numbers upto lakh as seen in the following 
table. (Let us call them placement boxes). Fill the entries in the blanks left.

MATHEMATICS 

Use of commas 

You must have noticed that in writing large numbers in the 

While writing 

sections above, we have often used commas. Commas help us 

number names, 
in reading and writing large numbers. In our Indian System 

we do not use 
of Numeration we use ones, tens, hundreds, thousands and commas. 
then lakhs and crores. Commas are used to mark thousands, 
lakhs and crores. The first comma comes after hundreds place (three digits from the 
right) and marks thousands. The second comma comes two digits later (five digits 
from the right). It comes after ten thousands place and marks lakh. The third comma 
comes after anothertwodigits(seven digitsfrom the right). Itcomes aftertenlakh 
place and marks crore. 

For example, 5, 08, 01, 592 

3, 32, 40, 781 

7, 27, 05, 062 

Try reading the numbers given above. Write five more numbers in this form and 
read them. 

International System of Numeration 

In the International System of Numeration, as it is being used we have ones, 
tens, hundreds, thousands and then millions. One million is a thousand 
thousands. Commas are used to mark thousands and millions. It comes after 
every three digits from the right. The first comma marks thousands and the 
next comma marks millions. For example, the number 50,801,592 is read in 
the International System as fifty million eight hundred one thousand five 
hundred ninety two. In the Indian System, it is five crore eight lakh one thousand 
five hundred ninety two. 

How many lakhs make a million? 

How many millions make a crore? 

Take three large numbers. Express them in both Indian and International 

Numeration systems. 

This may interest you : 

To express numbers larger than a million, a billion is used in the International 

System of Numeration: 1 billion = 1000 million.

1.3 Large Numbers in Practice 
In earlier classes, we have learnt that we use centimetre (cm) as a unit of length. 
For measuring the length of a pencil, the width of a book or 
notebooks etc., we use centimetres. Our ruler has marks on each centimetre. 

For measuring the thickness of a pencil, however, we find centimetre too big. 
We use millimetre (mm) to show the thickness of a pencil. 

1. How many 
centimetres make a 
kilometre? 
2. Name five large cities 
in India. Find their 
population. Also, find 
the distance in 
kilometres between 
each pair of these cities. 
(a) 10 millimetres = 1 centimetre 
To measure the length of the classroom or 
the school building, we shall find 
centimetre too small. We use metre for the 
purpose. 

(b) 1 metre = 100 centimetres 
= 1000 millimetres 
Even metre is too small, when we have to 
state distances between cities, say, Delhi 
and Mumbai, or Chennai and Kolkata. For 

12 

this we need kilometres (km). 


KNOWING OUR NUMBERS 

(c) 1 kilometre = 1000 metres 
How many millimetres make 1 kilometre? 
Since 1 m = 1000 mm 
1 km = 1000 m = 1000 × 1000 mm = 10,00,000 mm 
We go to the market to buy rice or wheat; we buy it in 
kilograms (kg). But items like ginger or chillies which 
we do not need in large quantities, we buy in grams (g). 
We know 1 kilogram = 1000 grams. 

Have you noticed the weight of the medicine tablets 
given to the sick? It is very small. It is in milligrams 
(mg). 

1 gram = 1000 milligrams. 

What is the capacity of a bucket for holding water? It 

is usually 20 litres (
..
). Capacity is given in litres. But 

sometimes we need a smaller unit, the millilitres. 

A bottle of hair oil, a cleaning liquid or a soft drink 

have labels which give the quantity of liquid inside in 
millilitres (ml). 
1 litre = 1000 millilitres. 

Note that in all these units we have some words 
common like kilo, milli and centi. You should remember 
that among these kilo is the greatest and milli is the 
smallest; kilo shows 1000 times greater, milli shows 
1000 times smaller, i.e. 1 kilogram = 1000 grams, 
1 gram = 1000 milligrams. 

Similarly, centi shows 100 times smaller, i.e. 1 metre = 100 centimetres. 

1. How many 
milligrams 
make one 
kilogram? 
2. A box contains 
2,00,000 
medicine tablets 
each weighing 
20 mg. What is 
the total weight 
of all the 
tablets in the

and in 
kilograms?

KNOWING OUR NUMBERS 

We have done a lot of problems that have addition, subtraction, multiplication 
and division. We will try solving some more here. Before starting, look at these 
examples and follow the methods used. 

Example 1 : Population of Sundarnagar was 2,35,471 in the year 1991. In the 
year 2001 it was found to be increased by 72,958. What was the population of 
the city in 2001? 

Solution : Population of the city in 2001 

= Population of the city in 1991 + Increase in population 

= 2,35,471 + 72,958 
Now, 235471 

+ 72958 

308429 

Salma added them by writing 235471 as 200000 + 35000 + 471 and 
72958 as 72000 + 958. She got the addition as 200000 + 107000 + 1429 = 308429. 
Mary added it as 200000 + 35000 + 400 + 71 + 72000 + 900 + 58 = 308429 

Answer : Population of the city in 2001 was 3,08,429. 

All three methods are correct. 

Example 2 : In one state, the number of bicycles sold in the year 2002-2003 
was 7,43,000. In the year 2003-2004, the number of bicycles sold was 8,00,100. 
In which year were more bicycles sold? and how many more? 

Solution : Clearly, 8,00,100 is more than 7,43,000. So, in that state, more 
bicycles were sold in the year 2003-2004 than in 2002-2003.

 Now, 800100 Check the answer by adding 

743000 
+ 57100 

– 743000 


057100 

800100 (the answer is right) 

Can you think of alternative ways of solving this problem? 
Answer : 57,100 more bicycles were sold in the year 2003-2004. 

Example 3 : The town newspaper is published every day. One copy has 
12 pages. Everyday 11,980 copies are printed. How many total pages are 
printed everyday? 

15 

MATHEMATICS 


Solution : Each copy has 12 pages. Hence, 11,980 copies will have 
12 × 11,980 pages. What would this number be? More than 1,00,000 or lesser. 
Try to estimate. 

Now, 11980 

× 12 
23960 
+ 119800 

143760 

Answer:Everyday 1,43,760 pages are printed. 
Example 4 : The number of sheets of paper available for making notebooks 
is 75,000. Each sheet makes 8 pages of a notebook. Each notebook contains 
200 pages. How many notebooks can be made from the paper available? 

Solution : Each sheet makes 8 pages. 
Hence, 75,000 sheets make 8 × 75,000 pages, 

Now, 75000 
× 8 
600000 

Thus, 6,00,000 pages are available for making notebooks. 
Now, 200 pages make 1 notebook. 
Hence, 6,00,000 pages make 6,00,000 ÷ 200 notebooks. 
3000 
Now, 200 600000

. 


– 600 
0000 The answer is 3,000 notebooks.

1.3.1 Estimation 
News 
1. India drew with Pakistan in a hockey match watched by 51,000 spectators 
in the stadium and 40 million television viewers world wide. 
2. Approximately, 2000 people were killed and more than 50000 injured in a 
cyclonic storm in coastal areas of India and Bangladesh. 
3. Over 13 million passengers are carried over 63,000 kilometre route of 
railway track every day. 
Can we say that there were exactly as many people as the numbers quoted 
in these news items? For example, 
In (1), were there exactly 51,000 spectators in the stadium? or did exactly 
40 million viewers watched the match on television? 
Obviously, not. The word approximately itself 
shows that the number of people were near about these 
numbers. Clearly, 51,000 could be 50,800 or 51,300 
but not 70,000. Similarly, 40 million implies much 
more than 39 million but quite less than 41 million 
but certainly not 50 million. 


17 

MATHEMATICS 


The quantities given in the examples above are not exact counts, but are 
estimates to give an idea of the quantity. 
Discuss what each of these can suggest. 

Where do we approximate? Imagine a big celebration at your home. The first 
thing you do is to find out roughly how many guests may visit you. Can you get an 
idea of the exact number of visitors? It is practically impossible. 

The finance minister of the country presents a budget annually. The minister provides 
for certain amount under the head ‘Education’. Can the amount be absolutely accurate? 
It can only be a reasonably good estimate of the expenditure the country needs for 
education during the year. 

Think about the situations where we need to have the exact numbers and compare 
them with situations where you can do with only an approximately estimated number. 
Give three examples of each of such situations. 

1.3.2 Estimating to the nearest tens by rounding off 
Look at the following : 


(a) Find which flags are closer to 260. 
(b) Find the flags which are closer to 270. 
Locate the numbers 10,17 and 20 on your ruler. Is 17 nearer to 10 or 20? The 
gap between 17 and 20 is smaller when compared to the gap between 17 and 10. 


So, we round off 17 as 20, correct to the nearest tens. 
Now consider 12, which also lies between 10 and 20. However, 12 is 

closer to 10 than to 20. So, we round off 12 to 10, correct to the nearest tens. 
How would you round off 76 to the nearest tens? Is it not 80? 
We see that the numbers 1,2,3 and 4 are nearer to 0 than to 10. So, we 

round off 1, 2, 3 and 4 as 0. Number 6, 7, 8, 9 are nearer to 10, so, we round 
them off as 10. Number 5 is equidistant from both 0 and 10; it is a common 
practice to round it off as 10. 

18 


KNOWING OUR NUMBERS 

Round these numbers to the nearest tens.

64 59 99 215 1453 2936 
1.3.3 Estimating to the nearest hundreds by rounding off 
Is 410 nearer to 400 or to 500? 
410 is closer to 400, so it is rounded off to 400, correct to the nearest 

hundred. 
889 lies between 800 and 900. 
It is nearer to 900, so it is rounded off as 900 correct to nearest hundred. 
Numbers 1 to 49 are closer to 0 than to 100, and so are rounded off to 0. 
Numbers 51 to 99 are closer to 100 than to 0, and so are rounded off to 100. 

Number 50 is equidistant from 0 and 100 both. It is a common practice to round it off 
as 100. 
Check if the following rounding off is correct or not : 

841 800; 9537 9500; 49730 49700; 
2546 2500; 286 200; 5750 5800; 
168 200; 149 100; 9870 9800. 

Correct those which are wrong. 

1.3.4 Estimating to the nearest thousands by rounding off 
We know that numbers 1 to 499 are nearer to 0 than to 1000, so these numbers are 
rounded off as 0. 

The numbers 501 to 999 are nearer to 1000 than 0 so they are rounded off as 
1000. 

Number 500 is also rounded off as 1000. 

Check if the following rounding off is correct or not : 

2573 3000; 53552 53000; 

6404 6000; 65437 65000; 

7805 7000; 3499 4000. 

Correct those which are wrong.

1.3.5 Estimating outcomes of number situations 
How do we add numbers? We add numbers by following the algorithm (i.e. the 
given method) systematically. We write the numbers taking care that the digits in the 
same place (ones, tens, hundreds etc.) are in the same column. For example, 

3946 + 6579 + 2050 is written as — 
Th H T O 
3 9 4 6 
6 5 7 9 
+ 2 0 5 0 

We add the column of ones and if necessary carry forward the appropriate 
number to the tens place as would be in this case. We then add the tens 
column and this goes on. Complete the rest of the sum yourself. This 
procedure takes time. 

There are many situations where we need to find answers more quickly. 
For example, when you go to a fair or the market, you find a variety of attractive 
things which you want to buy. You need to quickly decide what you can buy. 
So, you need to estimate the amount you need. It is the sum of the prices of 
things you want to buy. 

A trader is to receive money from two sources. The money he is to receive 
is Rs 13,569 from one source and Rs 26,785 from another. He has to pay 
Rs 37,000 to someone else by the evening. He rounds off the numbers to their 
nearest thousands and quickly works out the rough answer. He is happy that 
he has enough money. 

Do you think he would have enough money? Can you tell without doing 
the exact addition/subtraction? 

Sheila and Mohan have to plan their monthly expenditure. They know 
their monthly expenses on transport, on school requirements, on groceries, 

20 


KNOWING OUR NUMBERS 

on milk, and on clothes and also on other regular 
expenses. This month they have to go for visiting 
and buying gifts. They estimate the amount they 
would spend on all this and then add to see, if what 
they have, would be enough. 


Would they round off to thousands as the 
trader did? 

Think and discuss five more situations where we have to estimate sums or 
remainders. 

Did we use rounding off to the same place in all these? 

There are no rigid rules when you want to estimate the outcomes of numbers. 
The procedure depends on the degree of accuracy required and how quickly 
the estimate is needed. The most important thing is, how sensible the guessed 
answer would be. 

1.3.6 To estimate sum or difference 
As we have seen above we can round off a number to any place. The trader 
rounded off the amounts to the nearest thousands and was satisfied that he had 
enough. So, when you estimate any sum or difference, you should have an idea 
of why you need to round off and therefore the place to which you would round 
off. Look at the following examples. 

Example 5 : Estimate: 5,290 + 17,986. 
Solution : You find 17,986 > 5,290. 

Round off to thousands. 

17,986 is rounds off to 18,000 

+5,290 is rounds off to + 5,000 

Estimated sum = 23,000 

Does the method work? You may attempt to find the actual answer and 
verify if the estimate is reasonable. 
Example 6 : Estimate: 5,673 – 436. 

Solution : To begin with we round off to thousands. (Why?) 

5,673 rounds off to 6,000 
– 436 rounds off to – 0 
Estimated difference = 6,000 

This is not a reasonable estimate. Why is this not reasonable? 

21 

MATHEMATICS 


To get a closer estimate, let us try rounding each number to hundreds. 
5,673 rounds off to 5,700 

– 436 rounds off to – 400 
Estimated difference = 5,300 
This is a better and more meaningful estimate. 
1.3.7 To estimate products 
How do we estimate a product? 
What is the estimate for 19 × 78? 
It is obvious that the product is less than 2000. Why? 

If we approximate 19 to the nearest tens, we get 20 and then approximate 78 
to nearest tens, we get 80 and 20 × 80 = 1600 
Look at 63 × 182 

If we approximate both to the nearest hundreds we 
get 100 × 200 = 20,000. This is much larger than the 
actual product. So, what do we do? To get a more 
reasonable estimate, we try rounding off 63 to the 
nearest 10, i.e. 60, and also 182 to the nearest ten, i.e. 

180. We get 60 × 180 or 10,800. This is a good 
estimate, but is not quick enough. 
If we now try approximating 63 to 60 and 182 to 
the nearest hundred, i.e. 200, we get 60 × 200, and this 
number 12,000 is a quick as well as good estimate of 
the product. 

The general rule that we can make is, therefore, Round off each factor to its 
greatest place, then multiply the rounded off factors. Thus, in the above 
example, we rounded off 63 to tens and 182 to hundreds. 

Now, estimate 81 × 479 using this rule : 
479 is rounded off to 500 (rounding off to hundreds), 
and 81 is rounded off to 80 (rounding off to tens). 
The estimated product = 500 × 80 = 40,000 
An important use of estimates for you will be to check your answers. 


Suppose, you have done the multiplication 37 × 1889, but 
are not sure about your answer. A quick and reasonable estimate 
of the product will be 40 × 2000 i.e. 80,000. If your answer 
is close to 80,000, it is probably right. On the other hand, if 
it is close to 8000 or 8,00,000, something is surely wrong in 
your multiplication. 

22 

Same general rule may be followed by addition and 
subtraction of two or more numbers. 

Estimate the 
following products : 
(a) 87 × 313 
(b) 9 × 795 
(c) 898 × 785 
(d) 958 × 387 
Make five more 
such problems and 
solve them.

1.4 Using Brackets 
Suman bought 6 notebooks from the market and the cost was Rs 10 per notebook. 
Her sister Sama also bought 7 notebooks of the same type. Find the total money 
they paid. 

Seema calculated the Meera calculated the 
amount like this amount like this 

6 × 10 + 7 × 10 6 + 7 =13 
= 60 + 70 
= 130 and 13 × 10 = 130

1. Write the expressions for each of the following using brackets. 
(a) Four multiplied by the sum of nine and two. 
(b) Divide the difference of eighteen and six by four. 
(c) Forty five divided by three times the sum of three and two. 
2. Write three different situations for (5 + 8) × 6. 
(One such situation is : Sohani and Reeta work for 6 days; Sohani 
works 5 hours a day and Reeta 8 hours a day. How many hours do 
both of them work in a week?) 
3. Write five situations for the following where brackets would be 
necessary. (a) 7(8 – 3) (b) (7 + 2) (10 – 3) 

MATHEMATICS 


You can see that Seema’s and Meera’s ways to get the answer are a bit different. 

But both give the correct result. Why? 
Seema says, what Meera has done is 7 + 6 × 10. 
Appu points out that 7 + 6 × 10 = 7 + 60 = 67. Thus, this is not what Meera 

had done. All the three students are confused. 

To avoid confusion in such cases we may use brackets. We can pack the numbers 
6 and 7 together using a bracket, indicating that the pack is to be treated as a single 
number. Thus, the answer is found by (6 + 7) × 10 = 13 × 10. 

This is what Meera did. She first added 6 and 7 and then multiplied the sum 
by 10. 

This clearly tells us : First, turn everything inside the brackets ( ) into a 
single number and then do the operation outside which in this case is to 
multiply by 10. 

1.4.1 Expanding brackets 
Now, observe how use of brackets allows us to follow our procedure 
systematically. Do you think that it will be easy to keep a track of what steps we 
have to follow without using brackets? 

(i) 7 × 109 = 7 × (100 + 9) = 7 × 100 + 7 × 9 = 700 + 63 = 763 
(ii)102 × 103 = (100 + 2) × (100 + 3) = (100 + 2) × 100 + (100 + 2) × 3 
= 100 × 100 + 2 × 100 + 100 × 3 + 2 × 3 
= 10,000 + 200 + 300 + 6 = 10,000 + 500 + 6 
= 10,506 

(iii) 17 × 109 = (10 + 7) × 109 = 10 × 109 + 7 × 109 
= 10 × (100 + 9) + 7 × (100 + 9) 
= 10 × 100 + 10 × 9 + 7 × 100 + 7 × 9 
= 1000 + 90 + 700 + 63 = 1,790 + 63 
= 1,853 

1.5 Roman Numerals 
We have been using the Hindu-Arabic numeral system so far. This 
is not the only system available. One of the early systems of 
writing numerals is the system of Roman numerals. This system 
is still used in many places.

For example, we can see the use of Roman numerals in clocks; it 
is also used for classes in the school time table etc. 
Find three other examples, where Roman numerals are used.

The Roman numerals 


KNOWING OUR NUMBERS 

I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X 
denote 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and 10 respectively. This is followed by XI for 11, XII 

for 12,... till XX for 20. Some more Roman numerals are : 
IVXLC D M 
1 5 10 50 100 500 1000 
The rules for the system are : 

(a) If a symbol is repeated, its value is added as many times as it occurs: 
i.e. II is equal 2, XX is 20 and XXX is 30. 
(b) A symbol is not repeated more than three times. But the symbols V, L and D 
are never repeated. 
(c) If a symbol of smaller value is written to the right of a symbol of greater 
value, its value gets added to the value of greater symbol. 
VI = 5 + 1 = 6, XII = 10 + 2 = 12 
and LXV = 50 + 10 + 5 = 65 

(d) If a symbol of smaller value is written to the left of a symbol of greater 
value, its value is subtracted from the value of the greater symbol. 
IV = 5 – 1 = 4, IX = 10 – 1 = 9 
XL= 50 – 10 = 40, XC = 100 – 10 = 90 

(e) The symbols V, L and D are never written to the left of a symbol of greater 
value, i.e. V, L and D are never subtracted. 
The symbol I can be subtracted from V and X only. 
The symbol X can be subtracted from L, M and C only. 

Following these rules we get, 
1= I 10 = X 100 = C 
2=II 20 = XX 
3= III 30 = XXX 
4=IV 40 = XL 
5=V 50 = L 
6=VI 60 = LX 
7= VII 70 = LXX 
8 = VIII 80 = LXXX

MATHEMATICS 


Example 7 : Write in Roman Numerals (a) 69 (b) 98. 
Solution : (a) 69 = 60 + 9 (b) 98 = 90 + 8 
= (50 + 10) + 9 = (100 – 10) + 8 
= LX + IX = XC + VIII 
= LX IX = XCVIII 

What have we discussed? 

1. Given two numbers, one with more digits is the greater number. If the number of 
digits in two given numbers is the same, that number is larger, which has a greater 
leftmost digit. If this digit also happens to be the same, we look at the next digit and 
so on. 
2. In forming numbers from given digits, we should be careful to see if the conditions 
under which the numbers are to be formed are satisfied. Thus, to form the greatest 
four digit number from 7, 8, 3, 5 without repeating a single digit, we need to use all 
four digits, the greatest number can have only 8 as the leftmost digit. 
3. The smallest four digit number is 1000 (one thousand). It follows the largest three 
digit number 999. Similarly, the smallest five digit number is 10,000. It is ten thousand 
and follows the largest four digit number 9999. 
Further, the smallest six digit number is 100,000. It is one lakh and follows the largest 
five digit number 99,999. This carries on for higher digit numbers in a similar manner. 

4. Use of commas helps in reading and writing large numbers. In the Indian system of 
numeration we have commas after 3 digits starting from the right and thereafter every 
2 digits. The commas after 3, 5 and 7 digits separate thousand, lakh and crore 
respectively. In the International system of numeration commas are placed after every 
3 digits starting from the right. The commas after 3 and 6 digits separate thousand 
and million respectively. 
5. Large numbers are needed in many places in daily life. For example, for giving number 
of students in a school, number of people in a village or town, money paid or received 
in large transactions (paying and selling), in measuring large distances say betwen 
various cities in a country or in the world and so on. 
6. Remember kilo shows 1000 times larger, Centi shows 100 times smaller and milli 
shows 1000 times smaller, thus, 1 kilometre = 1000 metres, 1 metre = 100 centimetres 
or 1000 millimetres etc. 
7. There are a number of situations in which we do not need the exact quantity but need 
only a reasonable guess or an estimate. For example, while stating how many spectators 
watched a particular international hockey match, we state the approximate number, 
say 51,000, we do not need to state the exact number. 
26 


KNOWING OUR NUMBERS 

8. Estimation involves approximating a quantity to an accuracy required. Thus, 4117 
may be approximated to 4100 or to 4000, i.e. to the nearest hundred or to the 
nearest thousand depending on our need. 
9. In number of situations, we have to estimate the outcome of number operations. This 
is done by rounding off the numbers involved and getting a quick, rough answer. 
10. Estimating the outcome of number operations is useful in checking answers. 
11. Use of brackets allows us to avoid confusion in the problems where we need to 
carry out more than one number operation. 
12. We use the Hindu-Arabic system of numerals. Another system of writing numerals is 
the Roman system.

NmbrNumbesNumbersNumbersNumbers 
As we know, we use 1, 2, 3, 4,... when we begin to count. They come naturally 
when we start counting. Hence, mathematicians call the counting numbers as 
Natural numbers. 

Predecessor and successor 

Given any natural number, you can add 1 to 
that number and get the next number i.e. you 
get its successor. 

The successor of 16 is 16 + 1 = 17, 
that of 19 is 19 +1 = 20 and so on. 

The number 16 comes before 17, we 
say that the predecessor of 17 is 17–1=16, 
the predecessor of 20 is 20 – 1 = 19, and 
so on. 

The number 3 has a predecessor and a 
successor. What about 2? The successor is 
3 and the predecessor is 1. Does 1 have both 

a successor and a predecessor? 

We can count the number of children in our school; we 
can also count the number of people in a city; we can count 
the number of people in India. The number of people in the 
whole world can also be counted. We may not be able to 
count the number of stars in the sky or the number of hair 
on our heads but if we are able, there would be a number for 
them also. We can then add one more to such a number and 

1. Write the predecessor 
and successor of 
19; 1997; 12000; 
49; 100000. 
2. Is there any natural 
number that has no 
predecessor? 
3. Is there any natural 
number which has no 
successor? Is there a 
last natural number? 

WHOLE NUMBERS 

get a larger number. In that case we can even write the number of hair on two 
heads taken together. 

It is now perhaps obvious that there is no largest number. Apart from these 
questions shared above, there are many others that can come to our mind 
when we work with natural numbers. You can think of a few such questions 
and discuss them with your friends. You may not clearly know the answers to 
many of them ! 

2.2 Whole Numbers 
We have seen that the number 1 has no predecessor in natural numbers. To the 
collection of natural numbers we add zero as the predecessor for 1. 

The natural numbers along with zero form the collection of whole 
numbers. 
In your previous classes you have learnt to 
perform all the basic operations like addition, 
subtraction, multiplication and division on 
numbers. You also know how to apply them to 
problems. Let us try them on a number line. 
Before we proceed, let us find out what a 
number line is! 
1. Are all natural numbers 
also whole numbers? 
2. Are all whole numbers 
also natural numbers? 
3. Which is the greatest 
whole number? 
2.3 The Number Line 
Draw a line. Mark a point on it. Label it 0. Mark a second point to the right of 

0. Label it 1. 
The distance between these points labelled as 0 and 1 is called unit distance. 
On this line, mark a point to the right of 1 and at unit distance from 1 and 
label it 2. In this way go on labelling points at unit distances as 3, 4, 5,... on 
the line. You can go to any whole number on the right in this manner. 

This is a number line for the whole numbers. 


What is the distance between the points 2 and 4? Certainly, it is 2 units. 
Can you tell the distance between the points 2 and 6, between 2 and 7? 

On the number line you will see that the number 7 is on the right of 4. 
This number 7 is greater than 4, i.e. 7 > 4. The number 8 lies on the right of 6 

29 

MATHEMATICS 

and 8 > 6. These observations help us to say that, out of any two whole 
numbers, the number on the right of the other number is the greater number. 
We can also say that whole number on left is the smaller number. 

For example, 4 < 9; 4 is on the left of 9. Similarly, 12 > 5; 12 is to the 
right of 5. 

What can you say about 10 and 20? 

Mark 30, 12, 18 on the number line. Which number is at the farthest left? 
Can you say from 1005 and 9756, which number would be on the right 
relative to the other number.

 Place the successor of 12 and the predecessor of 7 on the number line. 

Addition on the number line 

Addition of whole numbers can be shown on the number line. Let us see the 
addition of 3 and 4. 


Start from 3. Since we add 4 to this number so we 
make 4 jumps to the right; from 3 to 4, 4 to 5, 5 to 6 and 6 
to 7 as shown above. The tip of the last arrow in the fourth 
jump is at 7. 

The sum of 3 and 4 is 7, i.e. 3 + 4 = 7. 

Subtraction on the number line 

The subtraction of two whole numbers can also be shown on the number line. 
Let us find 7 – 5. 

Find 4 + 5; 
2 + 6; 3 + 5 
and 1+6 
using the 
number line. 
Start from 7. Since 5 is being subtracted, so move 
towards left with 1 jump of 1 unit. Make 5 such jumps. We 
reach the point 2. We get 7 – 5 = 2. 

Multiplication on the number line 

We now see the multiplication of whole numbers on the 
number line. 

Let us find 3 × 4. 

Find 8 – 3; 
6 – 2; 9 – 6 
using the 
number line. 
30 

WHOLE NUMBERS 

Find 2 × 6; 
3 × 3; 4 × 2 
using the 
number line. 
Start from 0, move 3 units at a time to the right, make 
such 4 moves. Where do you reach? You will reach 12. 
So, we say, 3 × 4 = 12. 


EXERCISE 2.1 

1. Write the next three natural numbers after 10999. 
2. Write the three whole numbers occurring just before 10001.

6. Write the predecessor of : 
(a) 94 (b) 10000 (c) 208090 (d) 7654321 
7. In each of the following pairs of numbers, state which whole number is on the left of 
the other number on the number line. Also write them with the appropriate sign (>, <) 
between them. 
(a) 530, 503 (b) 370, 307 (c) 98765, 56789 (d) 9830415, 10023001 
8. Which of the following statements are true (T) and which are false (F) ? 
(a) Zero is the smallest natural number. (b) 400 is the predecessor of 399. 
(c) Zero is the smallest whole number. (d) 600 is the successor of 599. 
(e) All natural numbers are whole numbers. 
(f ) All whole numbers are natural numbers. 
(g) The predecessor of a two digit number is never a single digit number. 
(h) 1 is the smallest whole number. 
(i) The natural number 1 has no predecessor. 
( j) The whole number 1 has no predecessor. 
(k) The whole number 13 lies between 11 and 12. 
(l) The whole number 0 has no predecessor. 
(m) The successor of a two digit number is always a two digit number. 
2.4 Properties of Whole Numbers 
When we look into various operations on numbers closely, we notice several 
properties of whole numbers. These properties help us to understand the 
numbers better. Moreover, they make calculations under certain operations 
very simple. 

31 

MATHEMATICS 

DoThis
Let each one of you in the class take any two whole numbers and add them. 
Is the result always a whole number? 
Your additions may be like this: 


7 + 8 = 15, a whole number 
5 + 5 = 10, a whole number 
0 + 15 = 15, a whole number 
. + . = … 
. + . = … 

Try with five other pairs of numbers. Is the sum always a whole number? 

Did you find a pair of whole numbers whose sum is not a whole number? 
Hence, we say that sum of any two whole numbers is a whole number i.e. the 
collection of whole numbers is closed under addition. This property is known 
as the closure property for addition of whole numbers. 

Are the whole numbers closed under multiplication too? How will you 
check it? 

Your multiplications may be like this : 

7 × 8 = 56, a whole number 
5 × 5 = 25, a whole number 
0 × 15 = 0, a whole number 
. × . = … 
. × . = … 

The multiplication of two whole numbers is also found to be a whole 
number again. We say that the system of whole numbers is closed under 
multiplication. 

Closure property : Whole numbers are closed under addition and also 
under multiplication. 

Think, discuss and write 

1. The whole numbers 
are not closed under 
subtraction. Why? 
Your subtractions may 
be like this : 
6 – 2 = 4, a whole number 
7 – 8 = ?, not a whole number 
5 – 4 = 1, a whole number 
3 – 9 = ?, not a whole number 

Take a few examples of your own and confirm. 

32 


WHOLE NUMBERS 

2. Are the whole numbers closed under division? No. Observe this table : 
8 ÷ 4 = 2, a whole number 
5 ÷ 7 = 
5 
, not a whole number7 
12 ÷ 3 = 4, a whole number 
6 ÷ 5 = 
6 
, not a whole number5 

Justify it by taking a few more examples of your own. 

After how many moves did we 
reach 0? In four moves. 
So, we write 8 ÷ 2 = 4. 
Using this, find 24 ÷ 8; 16 ÷ 4. 
In every move we get 2 again ! 
Will this ever stop? No. 
We say 2 ÷ 0 is not defined. 
Division by zero 
Division by a number means subtracting that number repeatedly. 
Let us find 8 ÷ 2. 
8 
– 2 ........ 1 
6 
– 2 ........ 2 
4 
– 2 ........ 3 
2 
– 2 ........ 4 
0 
Let us now try 2 ÷ 0. 
2 
– 0 ........ 1 
2 
– 0 ........ 2 
2 
– 0 ........ 3 
2 
– 0 ........ 4 
2 
Subtract 2 again and again from 8. 
33 

MATHEMATICS 

Let us try 7 ÷ 0 
7 
– 0 ........ 1 
7 
– 0 ........ 2 
7 
– 0 ........ 3 
7 
Division of a whole number by 0 is not defined. 
Again, we never get 0 at any 
stage of subtraction. 
We say 7 ÷ 0 is not defined. 
Check it for 5 ÷ 0, 16 ÷ 0. 
Commutativity of addition and multiplication 

What do the following number line diagrams say? 


In both the cases we reach 5. So, 3 + 2 is same as 2 + 3. 
Similarly, 5 + 3 is same as 3 + 5. 


Try it for 4 + 6 and 6 + 4. 

Is this true when any two whole numbers are added? 
Check it. You will not get any pair of whole numbers for 
which the sum is different when the order of addition is 
changed. 


You can add two whole numbers in any order. 

We say that addition is commutative for whole numbers. This property is 
known as commutativity for addition. 

34 


WHOLE NUMBERS 

Discuss with your friends 

You have a small party at home. 
You want to arrange 6 rows of 
chairs with 8 chairs in each row 
for the visitors. The number of 
chairs you will need is 6 × 8. You 
find that the room is not wide 
enough to accommodate rows of 
8 chairs. You decide to have 8 rows of chairs with 6 chairs in each row. How 
many chairs do you require now? Will you require more number of chairs? 


Is there a commutative property of multiplication? 

Multiply numbers 4 and 5 in different orders. 

You will observe that 4 × 5 = 5 × 4. 
Is it true for the numbers 3 and 6; 5 and 7 also? 
You can multiply two whole numbers in any order. 
We say multiplication is commutative for whole numbers. 

Thus, addition and multiplication are commutative for whole numbers. 

Verify : 

(i) Subtraction in not commutative for whole numbers. Use at least three 
different pairs of numbers to verify it. 
(ii) Is (6 ÷ 3)same as (3 ÷ 6)? 
Justify it by taking few more combinations of whole numbers. 
Associativity of addition and multiplication 

Observe the following diagrams : 

(a) (2 + 3) + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9 
(b) 2 + (3 + 4) = 2 + 7 = 9 
In (a) above, you can add 2 and 3 first and then add 4 to the sum and 
in (b) you can add 3 and 4 first and then add 2 to the sum. 

Are not the results same? 

We also have, (5 + 7) + 3 = 12 + 3 = 15 and 5 + (7 + 3) = 5 + 10 = 15. 

So, (5 + 7) + 3 = 5 + (7 + 3) 

35 

MATHEMATICS 

This is associativity of addition for whole numbers. 
Check it for the numbers 2, 8 and 6. 
Example 1 : Add the numbers 234, 197 and 103. 

Notice how we 
grouped the numbers for 
convenience of adding. 
Solution : 234 + 197 + 103 = 234 + (197 + 103) 
= 234 + 300 = 534

Play this game 

You and your friend can play this. 

You call a number from 1 to 10. Your friend now adds to this number any 
number from 1 to 10. Then it is your turn. You both play alternately. The 
winner is the one who reaches 100 first. If you always want to win the game, 
what will be your strategy or plan? 


Observe the multiplication fact illustrated by the following diagrams 

(Fig 2.1). 

Count the number 
of dots in Fig 2.1 (a) 
and Fig 2.1 (b). What 

(a) (b)
do you get? The 

Fig 2.1

number of dots is the 

same. In Fig 2.1 (a), we have 2 × 3 dots in each box. So, the total number 
of dots is (2 × 3) × 4 = 24. 

In Fig 2.1 (b), each box has 3 × 4 dots, so in all there are 2 × (3 × 4) = 24 dots. 
Thus, (2 × 3) × 4 = 2 × (3 × 4). Similarly, you can see that (3 × 5) × 4 = 3 × (5 × 4) 

Try this for (5 × 6) × 2 and 5 × (6 × 2); (3 × 6) × 4 and 3 × (6 × 4). 

This is associative property for multiplication of whole numbers. 

36 


WHOLE NUMBERS 

Think on and find : 
Which is easier and why? 

(a)(6 × 5) × 3 or 6 × (5 × 3) 
(b)(9 × 4) × 25 or 9 × (4 × 25) 
Example 2 : Find 14 + 17 + 6 in two ways. 

Solution : (14 + 17) + 6 = 31 + 6 = 37, 
14 + 17 + 6 = 14 + 6 + 17 = (14 + 6) + 17 = 20 + 17 = 37 
Here, you have used a combination of associative and commutative properties 
for addition. 
Do you think using the commutative and the associative property has made 
the calculation easier? 

The associative property of 
multiplication is very useful in the 
following types of sums. 

Example 3 : Find 12 × 35. 
Solution : 12 × 35 = (6 × 2) × 35 = 6 × (2 × 35) = 6 × 70 = 420. 
In the above example, we have used associativity to get the advantage of 
multiplying the smallest even number by a multiple of 5. 


Find : 7 + 18 + 13; 16 + 12 + 4 
Example 4 : Find 8 × 1769 × 125 
Solution : 8 × 1769 × 125 = 8 × 125 × 1769 
(What property do you use here?) 
= (8 × 125) × 1769 
= 1000 × 1769 = 17,69,000. 

Find : 
25 × 8358 × 4 ; 
625 × 3759 × 8 
Think, discuss and write 

Is (16 ÷ 4) ÷ 2 = 16 ÷ (4 ÷ 2)? 
Is there an associative property for division? No. 
Discuss with your friends. Think of (28 ÷ 14) ÷ 2 and 28 ÷ (14 ÷ 2).

Distributivity of multiplication over addition 

Take a graph paper of size 6 cm by 8 cm having squares of size 1 cm × 1 cm. 

37 

MATHEMATICS 

How many squares do you have in all? 


Is the number 6 × 8? 
Now cut the sheet into two pieces of sizes 6 cm by 5 cm and 6 cm by 3 cm, as 
shown in the figure. 


Number of squares : Is it 6 × 5? Number of squares : Is it 6 × 3? 
In all, how many squares are there in both the pieces? 
Is it (6 × 5) + (6 × 3)? Does it mean that 6 × 8 = (6 × 5) + (6 × 3)? 
But, 6 × 8 = 6 × (5 + 3) 
Does this show that 6 × (5 + 3) = (6 × 5) + (6 × 3)? 
Similarly, you will find that 2 × (3 + 5) = (2 × 3) + (2 × 5) 
This is known as distributivity of multiplication over addition. 
find using distributivity : 4 × (5 + 8) ; 6 × (7 + 9); 7 × (11 + 9).

Example 5 : The school canteen charges Rs 20 for lunch and Rs 4 for milk for 
each day. How much money do you spend in 5 days on these things? 
Solution : This can be found by two methods. 
Method 1 : Find the amount for lunch for 5 days. 
Find the amount for milk for 5 days. 
Then add i.e. 
Cost of lunch = 5 × 20 = Rs 100 
Cost of milk = 5 × 4 = Rs 20 
Total cost = Rs (100 + 20) = Rs 120 
Method 2 : Find the total amount for one day. 
Then multiply it by 5 i.e. 
Cost of (lunch + milk) for one day = Rs (20 + 4) 
Cost for 5 days = Rs 5 × (20 + 4) = Rs (5 × 24) 
= Rs 120. 
The example shows that 
5 × (20 + 4) = (5 × 20) + (5 × 4) 
This is the principle of distributivity of multiplication over addition. 


Example 6 : Find 12 × 35 using distributivity. 

Solution : 12 × 35 = 12 × (30 + 5) 

= 12 × 30 +12 × 5 

= 360 + 60 = 420 

Example 7 : Simplify: 126 × 55 + 126 × 45 

Find 15 × 68; 17 × 23; 
69 × 78 + 22 × 69 using 
distributive property. 
Solution : 126 × 55 + 126 × 45 = 126 × (55 + 45)

 = 126 × 100

 = 12600. 

Identity (for addition and multiplication) 

How is the collection of whole numbers different 
from the collection of natural numbers? It is just 
the presence of 'zero' in the collection of whole 
numbers. This number 'zero' has a special role in 
addition. The following table will help you guess 
the role. 

When you add zero to any whole number what 
is the result? 

7 + 0 = 7 
5 + 0 = 5 
0 + 15 = 15 
0 + 26 = 26 
0 + ..... = ..... 

39 

MATHEMATICS 


It is the same whole number again! Zero is called an identity for addition 

of whole numbers or additive identity for whole numbers. 
Zero has a special role in multiplication too. Any number when multiplied 

by zero becomes zero! 

For example, observe the pattern : 

5 × 6 = 30 

5 × 5 = 25 


Observe how the products decrease. 
5 × 4 = 20 

Do you see a pattern? 
5 × 3 = 15 

Can you guess the last step? 
5 × 2 = ... 

Is this pattern true for other whole numbers also? 
5 × 1 = ... 

Try doing this with two different whole numbers. 
5 × 0 = ? 

You came across an additive identity for whole 
numbers. A number remains unchanged when added 
to zero. Similar is the case for a multiplicative 
identity for whole numbers. Observe this table. 

You are right. 1 is the identity for multiplication 
of whole numbers or multiplicative identity for 

7 × 1 = 7 
5 × 1 = 5 
1 × 12 = 12 
1 × 100 = 100 
1 × ...... = ......

Patterns Observation 

Observation of patterns can guide you in simplifying processes. Study the 
following: 

(a)117 + 9 = 117 + 10 – 1 = 127 – 1 = 126 
(b)117 – 9 = 117 – 10 + 1 = 107 + 1 = 108 

WHOLE NUMBERS 

(c)117 + 99 = 117 + 100 – 1 = 217 – 1 = 216 
(d)117 – 99 = 117 – 100 + 1 = 17 + 1 = 18 
Does this pattern help you to add or subtract numbers of the form 
9, 99, 999,…? 
Here is one more pattern : 

(a) 84 × 9 = 84 × (10 – 1) (b) 84 × 99 = 84 × (100 – 1) 
(c) 84 × 999 = 84 × (1000 – 1) 
Do you find a shortcut to multiply a number by numbers of the form 
9, 99, 999,…? 

Such shortcuts enable you to do sums verbally. 

The following pattern suggests a way of multiplying a number by 5 or 25 

or 125. (You can think of extending it further). 

10 960 100 9600 

(i) 96 × 5 = 96 × = =480 (ii) 96 × 25 = 96 × = = 2400

1000 96000 

(iii) 96 × 125 = 96 × = = 12000...

What does the pattern that follows suggest?

(i) 64 × 5 = 64 × = 32 × 10 = 320 × 1

(ii) 64 × 15 = 64 × = 32 × 30 = 320 × 3

5. Study the pattern : 
1 × 8 + 1 = 9 1234 × 8 + 4 = 9876 
12 × 8 + 2= 98 12345 × 8 + 5= 98765 
123 × 8 + 3 = 987 
Write the next two steps. Can you say how the pattern works? 
(Hint: 12345 = 11111 + 1111 + 111 + 11 + 1). 
What have we discussed? 

1. The numbers 1, 2, 3,... which we use for counting are known as natural numbers. 
2. If you add 1 to a natural number, we get its successor. If you subtract 1 from a natural 
number, you get its predecessor. 
3. Every natural number has a successor. Every natural number except 1 has a predecessor. 
4. If we add the number zero to the collection of natural numbers, we get the collection of 
whole numbers. Thus, the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3,... form the collection of whole numbers. 
5. Every whole number has a successor. Every whole number except zero has a 
predecessor. 
6. All natural numbers are whole numbers, but all whole numbers are not natural 
numbers. 
7. We take a line, mark a point on it and label it 0. We then mark out points to the right 
of 0, at equal intervals. Label them as 1, 2, 3,.... Thus, we have a number line with the 
whole numbers represented on it. We can easily perform the number operations of 
addition, subtraction and multiplication on the number line. 
8. Addition corresponds to moving to the right on the number line, whereas subtraction 
corresponds to moving to the left. Multiplication corresponds to making jumps of 
equal distance starting from zero. 
9. Adding two whole numbers always gives a whole number. Similarly, multiplying two 
whole numbers always gives a whole number. We say that whole numbers are closed 
under addition and also under multiplication. However, whole numbers are not closed 
under subtraction and under division. 
10. Division by zero is not defined. 
44 


WHOLE NUMBERS 

11. Zero is the identity for addition of whole numbers. The whole number 1 is the identity 
for multiplication of whole numbers. 
12. You can add two whole numbers in any order.You can multiply two whole numbers in 
any order. We say that addition and multiplication are commutative for whole numbers. 
13. Addition and multiplication, both, are associative for whole numbers. 
14. Multiplication is distributive over addition for whole numbers. 
15. Commutativity, associativity and distributivity properties of whole numbers are useful 
in simplifying calculations and we use them without being aware of them. 
16. Patterns with numbers are not only interesting, but are useful especially for verbal 
calculations and help us to understand properties of numbers better.

Ramesh has 6 marbles with him. He wants to arrange them in rows in such a way 
that each row has the same number of marbles. He arranges them in the following 
ways and matches the total number of marbles. 

(i) 1 marble in each row 
Number of rows = 6 
Total number of marbles = 1 × 6 = 6 
(ii) 2 marbles in each row 
Number of rows = 3 
Total number of marbles = 2 × 3 = 6 
(iii) 3 marbles in each row 
Number of rows = 2 
Total number of marbles = 3 × 2 = 6 
(iv) He could not think of any arrangement in which each row had 4 marbles or 
5 marbles. So, the only possible arrangement left was with all the 6 marbles 
in a row. 
Number of rows = 1 
Total number of marbles = 6 × 1 = 6 
From these calculations Ramesh observes that 6 can be written as a product 
of two numbers in different ways as 
6 = 1 × 6; 6 = 2 × 3; 6 = 3 × 2; 6 = 6 × 1 


PLAYING WITH NUMBERS 

From 6 = 2 × 3 it can be said that 2 and 3 exactly divide 6. So, 2 and 3 are 
exact divisors of 6. From the other product 6 = 1 × 6, the exact divisors of 6 are 
found to be 1 and 6. 

Thus, 1, 2, 3 and 6 are exact divisors of 6. They are called the factors of 6. 
Try arranging 18 marbles in rows and find the factors of 18. 

3.2 Factors and Multiples 
Mary wants to find those numbers which exactly divide 4. She divides 4 by 
numbers less than 4 this way. 

1) 4 (4 2) 4 (2 3) 4 (1 4) 4 (1

0 0 1 0 
Quotient is 4 Quotient is 2 Quotient is 1 Quotient is 1 
Remainder is 0 Remainder is 0 Remainder is 1 Remainder is 0 
4 = 1 × 4 4 = 2 × 2 4 = 4 × 1 

She finds that the number 4 can be written as: 4 = 1 × 4; 4 = 2 × 2; 
4 = 4 × 1 and knows that the numbers 1, 2 and 4 are exact divisors of 4. 
These numbers are called factors of 4. 

A factor of a number is an exact divisor of that number. 

Observe each of the factors of 4 is less than or equal to 4.

Suppose the card has number 28 on it. 
(c) Player B then picks up all those cards having numbers which are factors of 
the number on A’s card (i.e. 28), and puts them in a pile near him. 
(d) Player B then picks up a card from the table and keeps it with him. From the 
cards that are left, A picks up all those cards whose numbers are factors of 
the number on B’s card. A puts them on the previous card that he collected.

When we write a number 20 as 20 = 4 × 5, we say 4

. 
The representation 24 = 2 × 12 shows that 2 and 12 4 × 5 = 20

Let us now see some interesting facts about factors and 
multiples. 

(a) Collect a number of wooden/paper strips of length 3 
units each. 
(b) Join them end to end as shown in the following 
figure. 
6 
The length of the strip at the top is 3 = 1 × 3 units. 

9 
The length of the strip below it is 3 + 3 = 6 units.

Also, 6 = 2 × 3. The length of the next strip is 3 + 3 + 

33

33 3

3 = 9 units, and 9 = 3 × 3. Continuing this way we 
can express the other lengths as, 

12 = 4 × 3 ; 15 = 5 × 3 
We say that the numbers 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 are multiples of 3. 
The list of multiples of 3 can be continued as 18, 21, 24, ... 
Each of these multiples is greater than or equal to 3. 
The multiples of the number 4 are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, ...

48 

The list is endless. Each of these numbers is greater than or equal to 4.

Find the possible 
factors of 45, 30 
and 36. 

PLAYING WITH NUMBERS 

Let us see what we conclude about factors and multiples: 

1. Is there any number which occurs as a factor of every number ? Yes. It is 1. 
For example 6 = 1 × 6, 18 = 1 × 18 and so on. Check it for a few more 
numbers. 
We say 1 is a factor of every number. 

2. Can 7 be a factor of itself ? Yes. You can write 7 as 7 = 7 × 1. What about 10? 
and 15?. 
You will find that every number can be expressed in this way. 
We say that every number is a factor of itself. 

3. What are the factors of 16? They are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. Out of these factors do 
you find any factor which does not divide 16? Try it for 20; 36. 
You will find that every factor of a number is an exact divisor of 
that number. 

4. What are the factors of 34? They are 1, 2, 17 and 34 itself. Out of these 
which is the greatest factor? It is 34 itself. 
The other factors 1, 2 and 17 are less than 34. Try to check this for 64, 
81 and 56. 
We say that every factor is less than or equal to the given number. 

5. The number 76 has 5 factors. How many factors does 136 or 96 have? You 
will find that you are able to count the number of factors of each of these. 
Even if the numbers are as large as 10576, 25642 etc. or larger, you 
can still count the number of factors of such numbers, (though you may 
find it difficult to factorise such numbers). 

We say that number of factors of a given number are finite. 

6. What are the multiples of 7? Obviously, 7, 14, 21, 28,... You will find that 
each of these multiples is greater than or equal to 7. Will it happen with 
each number? Check this for the multiples of 6, 9 and 10. 
We find that every multiple of a number is greater than or equal to 
that number. 

7. Write the multiples of 5. They are 5, 10, 15, 20, ... Do you think this 
list will end anywhere? No! The list is endless. Try it with multiples of 
6,7 etc. 
We find that the number of multiples of a given number is infinite. 

8. Can 7 be a multiple of itself ? Yes, because 7 = 7×1. Will it be true for other 
numbers also? Try it with 3, 12 and 16. 
You will find that every number is a multiple of itself.

MATHEMATICS 


The factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6. Also, 1+2+3+6 = 12 = 2 × 6. We find that 
the sum of the factors of 6 is twice the number 6. All the factors of 28 are 1, 2, 
4, 7, 14 and 28. Adding these we have, 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 + 28 = 56 = 2 × 28. 

The sum of the factors of 28 is equal to twice the number 28. 

A number for which sum of all its factors is equal to twice the number is 
called a perfect number. The numbers 6 and 28 are perfect numbers. 
Is 10 a perfect number? 

Example 1 : Write all the factors of 68. 

Solution : We note that 

68 = 1 × 68 68 = 2 × 34 

68 = 4 × 17 68 = 17 × 4 

Stop here, because 4 and 17 have occurred earlier. 

Thus, all the factors of 68 are 1, 2, 4, 17, 34 and 68. 

Example 2 : Find the factors of 36. 

Solution : 36 = 1 × 36 36 = 2 × 18 36 = 3 × 12 
36 = 4 × 9 36 = 6 × 6 
Stop here, because both the factors (6) are same. Thus, the factors are 1, 2, 
3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 36. 

Example 3 : Write first five multiples of 6. 

Solution : The required multiples are: 6×1= 6, 6×2 = 12, 6×3 = 18, 6×4 = 24, 
6×5 = 30 i.e. 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30.

3.3 Prime and Composite Numbers 
We are now familiar with the factors of a number. Observe the number of factors 
of a few numbers arranged in this table. 

Numbers Factors Number of Factors 
1 1 1 
2 1, 2 2 
3 1, 3 2 
4 1, 2, 4 3 
5 1, 5 2 
6 1, 2, 3, 6 4

9 1, 3, 9 3 
10 1, 2, 5, 10 4 
11 1, 11 2 
12 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 6 

We find that (a) The number 1 has only one factor (i.e. itself ). 

(b) There are numbers, having exactly two factors 1 and the number itself. Such 
number are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 etc. These numbers are prime numbers. 
The numbers other than 1 whose only factors are 1 and the number itself 
are called Prime numbers. 

Try to find some more prime numbers other than these. 

(c) There are numbers having more than two factors like 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 and so on. 
These numbers are composite numbers. 
Numbers having more than two factors are 
1 is neither a prime nor called Composite numbers. 
a composite number. Is 15 a composite number? Why? What about 
18? 25? 

Without actually checking the factors of a number, we can find prime 
numbers from 1 to 100 with an easier method. This method was given by a 

51 

MATHEMATICS 

Greek Mathematician Eratosthenes, in the third century B.C. Let us see the 
method. List all numbers from 1 to 100, as shown below. 


1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 
21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 
31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 
41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 
51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 
61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 
71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 
81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 
91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 
Step 1 : Cross out 1 because it is not a prime number. 

Step 2 : Encircle 2, cross out all the multiples of 2, other than 2 itself, i.e. 4, 6, 
8 and so on. 
Step 3 : You will find that the next uncrossed number is 3. Encircle 3 and cross 

out all the multiples of 3, other than 3 itself. 

Step 4 : The next uncrossed number is 5. Encircle 5 and cross out all the multiples 
of 5 other than 5 itself. 
Step 5 : Continue this process till all the 

numbers in the list are either encircled or 
crossed out. 
All the encircled numbers are prime 
numbers. All the crossed out numbers, 
other than 1 are composite numbers. 
This method is called the Sieve of 
Eratosthenes. 

Example 4 : Write all the prime numbers less than 15. 

Solution : By observing the Sieve Method, we can easily write the required 
prime numbers as 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 and 13. 

even and odd numbers 

Do you observe any pattern in the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, ...? You will 
find that each of them is a multiple of 2. 

These are called even numbers. The rest of the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,... 
are called odd numbers. 

52 

Observe that 2 × 3 + 1 = 7 is a 
prime number. Here, 1 has been 
added to a multiple of 2 to get a 
prime number. Can you find 
some more numbers of this type? 

PLAYING WITH NUMBERS 

You can verify that a two digit number or a three digit number is even or not. 
How will you know whether a number like 756482 is even? By dividing it by 2. 
Will it not be tedious? 

We say that a number with 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 at the ones place is an even number. 
So, 350, 4862, 59246 are even numbers. The numbers 457, 2359, 8231 are all 
odd. Let us try to find some interesting facts: 

(a) Which is the smallest even number? It is 2. Which is the smallest prime 
number? It is again 2. 
Thus, 2 is the smallest prime number which is even. 

(b) The other prime numbers are 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ... . Do you find any even number 
in this list? Of course not, they are all odd. 
Thus, we can say that every prime number except 2 is odd.

3.4 Tests for Divisibility of Numbers 
Is the number 38 divisible by 2? by 4? by 5? 
By actually dividing 38 by these numbers we find that it is divisible by 2 but 
not by 4 and by 5. 

Let us see whether we can find a pattern that can tell us whether a number is 
divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 or 11. Do you think such patterns can be easily 
seen? 

Divisibility by 10 : Charu was looking at the multiples of 

10. The multiples are 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, ... . She found 
something common in these numbers. Can you tell what? 
Each of these numbers has 0 in the ones place. 
She thought of some more numbers with 0 at ones place 
like 100, 1000, 3200, 7010. She also found that all such numbers are divisible 
by 10. 

She finds that if a number has 0 in the ones place then it is divisible by 10. 

Can you find out the divisibility rule for 100? 
Divisibility by 5 : Mani found some interesting pattern in the numbers 5, 10, 
15, 20, 25, 30, 35, ... Can you tell the pattern? Look at the units place. All these 
numbers have either 0 or 5 in their ones place. We know that these numbers are 
divisible by 5. 

Mani took up some more numbers that are divisible by 5, like 105, 215, 
6205, 3500. Again these numbers have either 0 or 5 in their ones places. 

He tried to divide the numbers 23, 56, 97 by 5. Will he be able to do that? 
Check it. He observes that a number which has either 0 or 5 in its ones 
place is divisible by 5, other numbers leave a remainder.

and also numbers like 2410, 4356, 1358, 2972, 5974. She finds some pattern 



PLAYING WITH NUMBERS 

in the ones place of these numbers. Can you tell that? These numbers have only 

the digits 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 in the ones place. 
She divides these numbers by 2 and gets remainder 0. 
She also finds that the numbers 2467, 4829 are not divisible by 2. These 

numbers do not have 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8 in their ones place. 
Looking at these observations she concludes that a number is divisible 

by 2 if it has any of the digits 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8 in its ones place. 
Divisibility by 3 : Are the numbers 21, 27, 36, 54, 219 divisible by 3? Yes, 
they are. 

Are the numbers 25, 37, 260 divisible by 3? No. 

Can you see any pattern in the ones place? We cannot, because numbers 
with the same digit in the ones places can be divisible by 3, like 27, or may 
not be divisible by 3 like 17, 37. Let us now try to add the digits of 21, 36, 54 
and 219. Do you observe anything special ? 2+1=3, 3+6=9, 5+4=9, 2+1+9=12. 
All these additions are divisible by 3. 

Add the digits in 25, 37, 260. We get 2+5=7, 3+7=10, 2+6+0 = 8. 
These are not divisible by 3. 
We say that if the sum of the digits is a multiple of 3, then the number 

is divisible by 3. 

Divisibility by 6 : Can you identify a number which is divisible 
by both 2 and 3? One such number is 18. Will 18 be divisible by 
2×3=6? Yes, it is. 
Find some more numbers like 18 and check if they are divisible 
by 6 also. 
Can you quickly think of a number which is divisible by 2 but 
not by 3? 
Now for a number divisible by 3 but not by 2, one example is 

27. Is 27 divisible by 6? No. Try to find numbers like 27. 
From these observations we conclude that if a number is 
divisible by 2 and 3 both then it is divisible by 6 also. 
Divisibility by 4 : Can you quickly give five 3-digit numbers divisible by 
4? One such number is 212. Think of such 4-digit numbers. One example is 
1936. 

Observe the number formed by the ones and tens places of 212. It is 12; 
which is divisible by 4. For 1936 it is 36, again divisible by 4. 
Try the exercise with other such numbers, for example with 4612; 

3516; 9532. 
Is the number 286 divisible by 4? No. Is 86 divisible by 4? No. 
So, we see that a number with 3 or more digits is divisible by 4 if the 

Is 7221 divisible by 3? 
55 

MATHEMATICS 

number formed by its last two digits (i.e. ones and tens) is divisible by 4. 

Check this rule by taking ten more examples. 
Divisibility for 1 or 2 digit numbers by 4 has to be checked by actual division. 

Divisibility by 8 : Are the numbers 1000, 2104, 1416 divisible by 8? 
You can check that they are divisible by 8. Let us try to see the pattern. 
Look at the digits at ones, tens and hundreds place of these numbers. These 

are 000, 104 and 416 respectively. These too are divisible by 8. Find some more 
numbers in which the number formed by the digits at units, tens and hundreds 
place (i.e. last 3 digits) is divisible by 8. For example, 9216, 8216, 7216, 10216, 
9995216 etc. You will find that the numbers themselves are divisible by 8. 

We find that a number with 4 or more digits is divisible by 8, if the 
number formed by the last three digits is divisible by 8. 

Is 73512 divisible by 8? 
The divisibility for numbers with 1, 2 or 3 digits by 8 has to be checked by 

actual division. 
Divisibility by 9 : The multiples of 9 are 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54,... There are 
other numbers like 4608, 5283 that are also divisible by 9. 

Do you find any pattern when the digits of these numbers are added? 
1 + 8 = 9, 2 + 7 = 9, 3 + 6 = 9, 4 + 5 = 9 
4 + 6 + 0 + 8 = 18, 5 + 2 + 8 + 3 = 18 
All these sums are also divisible by 9. 
Is the number 758 divisible by 9? 
No. The sum of its digits 7 + 5 + 8 = 20 is also not divisible by 9. 
These observations lead us to say that if the sum of the digits of a number 

is divisible by 9, then the number itself is divisible by 9. 
Divisibility by 11 : The numbers 308, 1331 and 61809 are all divisible by 11. 
We form a table and see if the digits in these numbers lead us to some pattern. 

Number Sum of the digits Sum of the digits Difference 
(at odd places) (at even places) 
from the right from the right 
308 8 + 3 = 11 0 11 – 0 = 11 
1331 1 + 3 = 4 3 + 1 = 4 4 – 4 = 0 
61809 9 + 8 + 6 = 23 0 + 1 = 1 23 – 1 = 22 

We observe that in each case the difference is either 0 or divisible by 11. All 
these numbers are also divisible by 11. 

For the number 5081, the difference of the digits is (5+8) – (1+0) = 12 
which is not divisible by 11. The number 5081 is also not divisible by 11. 

56 


PLAYING WITH NUMBERS 

Thus, to check the divisibility of a number by 11, the rule is, find the 
difference between the sum of the digits at odd places (from the right) 
and the sum of the digits at even places (from the right) of the number. 
If the difference is either 0 or divisible by 11, then the number is 
divisible by 11.

The factors of 4 are 1, 2 and 4. 
The factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 18. 
The numbers 1 and 2 are the factors of both 4 and 18. 
They are the common factors of 4 and 18. 
(b) What are the common factors of 4 and 15? 
These two numbers have only 1 as the common factor. 
What about 7 and 16? 
Two numbers having only 1 as a common factor are called co-prime 
numbers. Thus, 4 and 15 are co-prime numbers.

Factors of 60 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 30 and 60.

3.6 Some More Divisibility Rules 
Let us observe a few more rules about the divisibility of numbers. 

(i) Can you give a factor of 18? It is 9. Name a factor of 9? It is 3. Is 3 a factor 
of 18? Yes it is. Take any other factor of 18, say 6. Now, 2 is a factor of 6 
and it also divides 18. Check this for the other factors of 18. Consider 24. 
It is divisible by 8 and the factors of 8 i.e. 1, 2, 4 and 8 also divide 24. 
So, we may say that if a number is divisible by another number then 
it is divisible by each of the factors of that number. 

59 

MATHEMATICS 

(ii) The number 80 is divisible by 4 and 5. It is also divisible by 
4 × 5 = 20, and 4 and 5 are co-primes. 
Similarly, 60 is divisible by 3 and 5 which are co-primes. 60 is also divisible 
by 3 × 5 = 15. 
If a number is divisible by two co-prime numbers then it is divisible 
by their product also. 

(iii) The numbers 16 and 20 are both divisible by 4. The number 16 + 20 = 36 is 
also divisible by 4. Check this for other pairs of numbers. 
Try this for other common divisors of 16 and 20. 
If two given numbers are divisible by a number, then their sum is 
also divisible by that number. 

(iv) The numbers 35 and 20 are both divisible by 5. Is their difference 
35 – 20 = 15 also divisible by 5 ? Try this for other pairs of numbers also. 
If two given numbers are divisible by a number, then their difference 
is also divisible by that number. 

Take different pairs of numbers and check the four rules given above. 

3.7 Prime Factorisation 
When a number is expressed as a product of its factors we say that the number 
has been factorised. Thus, when we write 24 = 3×8, we say that 24 has been 
factorised. This is one of the factorisations of 24. The others are : 

24 = 2 × 12 24 = 4 × 6 24 = 3 × 8 
= 2 × 2 × 6 = 2 × 2 × 6 = 3 × 2 × 2 × 2 
= 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 

In all the above factorisations of 24, we ultimately arrive at only one 
factorisation 2 × 2 × 2 × 3. In this factorisation the only factors 2 and 3 are 
prime numbers. Such a factorisation of a number is called a prime factorisation. 

Let us check this for the number 36. 

36 
2 × 18 3 × 12 4 × 9 6 × 6 
2 × 2 × 9 3 × 3 × 4 2 × 2 × 9 2 × 3 × 6 
2 × 2 × 3 × 3 3 × 3 × 2 × 2 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 2 × 3 × 2 × 3 
2 × 2 × 3 × 3 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 
The prime factorisation of 36 is 2 × 2 × 3 × 3. i.e. the only prime 
factorisation of 36.

3.8 Highest Common Factor 
We can find the common factors of any two numbers. We now try to find the 

highest of these common factors. 
What are the common factors of 12 and 16? They are 1, 2 and 4. 
What is the highest of these common factors? It is 4. 
What are the common factors of 20, 28 and 36? They are 1, 2 and 4 and 

again 4 is highest of these common factors. 

The Highest Common Factor 
(HCF) of two or more given 
numbers is the highest (or 
greatest) of their common factors. 

It is also known as Greatest Common 

Divisor (GCD). 
The HCF of 20, 28 and 36 can also be found by prime factorisation of these 
numbers as follows: 

Find the HCF of the following: 
(i) 24 and 36 (ii) 15, 25 and 30 
(iii) 8 and 12 (iv) 12, 16 and 28

Thus, 20 = 2 × 2 × 5 

28 = 2 × 2 × 7 

36 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 

The common factor of 20, 28 and 36 is 2(occuring twice). Thus, HCF of 20, 
28 and 36 is 2 × 2 = 4.

3. HCF of co-prime numbers 4 and 15 was found as follows by factorisation : 
4 = 2 × 2 and 15 = 3 × 5 since there is no common prime factor, so HCF of 4 and 15 
is 0. Is the answer correct? If not, what is the correct HCF? 

3.9 Lowest Common Multiple 
What are the common multiples of 4 and 6? They are 12, 24, 36, ... . Which is 
the lowest of these? It is 12. We say that lowest common multiple of 4 and 6 is 

12. It is the smallest number that both the numbers are factors of this number. 
The Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of two or more given numbers is 
the lowest (or smallest or least) of their common multiples. 

What will be the LCM of 8 and 12? 4 and 9? 6 and 9? 

Example 8 : Find the LCM of 12 and 18. 

Solution : We know that common multiples of 12 and 18 are 36, 72, 108 etc. 
The lowest of these is 36. Let us see another method to find LCM of two 
numbers. 

The prime factorisations of 12 and 18 are : 
12 = 2 × 2 × 3; 18 = 2 × 3 × 3 
In these prime factorisations, the maximum number of times the prime 

factor 2 occurs is two; this happens for 12. Similarly, the maximum number 
of times the factor 3 occurs is two; this happens for 18. The LCM of the two 
numbers is the product of the prime factors counted the maximum number 
of times they occur in any of the numbers. Thus, in this case LCM = 2 × 2 
× 3 × 3 = 36. 

Example 9 : Find the LCM of 24 and 90. 

Solution : The prime factorisations of 24 and 90 are: 
24 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3; 90 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 

In these prime factorisations the maximum number of times the prime factor 
2 occurs is three; this happens for 24. Similarly, the maximum number of times 
the prime factor 3 occurs is two; this happens for 90. The prime factor 5 occurs 
only once in 90. 

Thus, LCM = (2 × 2 × 2) × (3 × 3) × 5 = 360 
Example 10 : Find the LCM of 40, 48 and 45. 
Solution : The prime factorisations of 40, 48 and 45 are; 

40 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 
48 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 
45 = 3 × 3 × 5 
The prime factor 2 appears maximum number of four times in the prime 

64 

factorisation of 48, the prime factor 3 occurs maximum number of two times 


PLAYING WITH NUMBERS 

in the prime factorisation of 45, The prime factor 5 appears one time in the 

prime factorisations of 40 and 45, we take it only once. 
Therefore, required LCM = (2 × 2 × 2 × 2)×(3 × 3) × 5 = 720 
LCM can also be found in the following way : 

Example 11 : Find the LCM of 20, 25 and 30. 

Solution : We write the numbers as follows in a row :

So, LCM = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 × 5. 

(A) Divide by the least prime number which divides any one of the given 
numbers. Here, it is 2. The numbers like 25 are not divisible by 2 so they 
are written as such in the next row. 
(B) Again divide by 2. Continue this till we have no multiples of 2. 
(C) Divide by next prime number which is 3. 
(D) Divide by next prime number which is 5. 
(E) Again divide by 5. 
3.10 Some Problems on HCF and LCM 
We come across a number of situations in which we make use of the concepts 
of HCF and LCM. We explain these situations through a few examples. 

Example 12 : Two tankers contain 850 litres and 680 litres of kerosene oil 
respectively. Find the maximum capacity of a container which can measure the 
kerosene oil of both the tankers when used an exact number of times. 

Solution : The required container has to measure 
both the tankers in a way that the count is an exact 
number of times. So its capacity must be an exact 
divisor of the capacities of both the tankers. 
Moreover, this capacity should be maximum. Thus, 
the maximum capacity of such a container will be 

65 
the HCF of 850 and 680. 


MATHEMATICS 

It is found as follows : 


2 850 
5 425 
5 85 
17 17 
1 

2 680 
2 340 
2 170 
5 85 
17 17 
1 

Hence, 

850 = 2 × 5 × 5 × 17 =2 × 5 × 17 × 5 and 

680 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 17= 2 × 5 × 17 × 2 × 2 

The common factors of 850 and 680 are 2, 5 and 17. 

Thus, the HCF of 850 and 680 is 2 × 5 × 17 = 170. 

Therefore, maximum capacity of the required container is 170 litres. 

It will fill the first container in 5 and the second in 4 refills. 

Example 13 : In a morning walk, three persons step off together. Their steps 
measure 80 cm, 85 cm and 90 cm respectively. What is the minimum distance 
each should walk so that all can cover the same distance in complete steps? 

Solution : The distance covered by each one of them is required to be the 
same as well as minimum. The required minimum distance each should walk 
would be the lowest common multiple of the measures of their steps. Can you 
describe why? Thus, we find the LCM of 80, 85 and 90. The LCM of 80, 85 
and 90 is 12240. 

The required minimum distance is 12240 cm. 

Example 14 : Find the least number which when divided by 12, 16, 24 and 36 
leaves a remainder 7 in each case. 

Solution : We first find the LCM of 12, 16, 24 and 36 as follows : 


2 12 16 24 36 
2 6 8 12 18 
2 3 4 6 9 
2 3 2 3 9 
3 3 1 3 9 
3 1 1 1 3 
1 1 1 1 

Thus, LCM = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 = 144

66 


PLAYING WITH NUMBERS 

144 is the least number which when divided by the given numbers will leave 
remainder 0 in each case. But we need the least number that leaves remainder 7 
in each case. 

Therefore, the required number is 7 more than 144. The required least 
number = 144 + 7 = 151.

MATHEMATICS 


What have we discussed? 

1. We have discussed multiples, divisors, factors and have seen how to identify factors 
and multiples. 
2. We have discussed and discovered the following : 
(a) A factor of a number is an exact divisor of that number. 
(b) Every number is a factor of itself. 1 is a factor of every number. 
(c) Every factor of a number is less than or equal to the given number. 
(d) Every number is a multiple of each of its factors. 
(e) Every multiple of a given number is greater than or equal to that number. 
(f) Every number is a multiple of itself. 
3. We have learnt that – 
(a) The number other than 1, with only factors namely 1 and the number itself, is a 
prime number. Numbers that have more than two factors are called composite 
numbers. Number 1 is neither prime nor composite. 
(b) The number 2 is the smallest prime number and is even. Every prime number other 
than 2 is odd. 
(c) Two numbers with only 1 as a common factor are called co-prime numbers. 
(d) If a number is divisible by another number then it is divisible by each of the factors 
of that number. 
(e) A number divisible by two co-prime numbers is divisible by their product also. 
4. We have discussed how we can find just by looking at a number, whether it is divisible 
by small numbers 2,3,4,5,8,9 and 11. We have explored the relationship between 
digits of the numbers and their divisibility by different numbers. 
(a) Divisibility by 2,5 and 10 can be seen by just the last digit. 
(b) Divisibility by 3 and 9 is checked by finding the sum of all digits. 
(c) Divisibility by 4 and 8 is checked by the last 2 and 3 digits respectively. 
(d) Divisibility of 11 is checked by comparing the sum of digits at odd and even 
places. 
5. We have discovered that if two numbers are divisible by a number then their 
sum and difference are also divisible by that number. 
6. We have learnt that – 
(a) The Highest Common Factor (HCF) of two or more given numbers is the highest 
of their common factors. 
(b) The Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of two or more given numbers is the lowest 
of their common multiples.

Geometry has a long and rich history. The term ‘Geometry’ is the English 
equivalent of the Greek word ‘Geometron’. ‘Geo’ means Earth and ‘metron’ 
means Measurement. According to 
historians, the geometrical ideas shaped up 
in ancient times, probably due to the need 
in art, architecture and measurement. These 
include occasions when the boundaries of 
cultivated lands had to be marked without 
giving room for complaints. Construction of 
magnificent palaces, temples, lakes, dams 
and cities, art and architecture propped up 
these ideas. Even today geometrical ideas 
are reflected in all forms of art, 
measurements, architecture, engineering, cloth designing etc. You observe 
and use different objects like boxes, tables, books, the tiffin box you carry 
to your school for lunch, the ball with which you play and 
so on. All such objects have different shapes. The ruler which you use, the 
pencil with which you write are straight. The pictures of a bangle, the one 
rupee coin or a ball appear round. 

Here, you will learn some interesting facts that will help you know more 
about the shapes around you. 

4.2 Points 
By a sharp tip of the pencil, mark a dot on the paper. Sharper the tip, thinner 
will be the dot. This almost invisible tiny dot will give you an idea of a point. 



MATHEMATICS 


A point determines 
a location. 
These are some 
models for a point :

points on a paper, you

by a single capital letter like A,B,C.

These points will be read as point A, point B and point C. 
..A 

Of course, the dots have to be invisibly thin.

..C 


4.3 A Line Segment 
Fold a piece of paper and unfold it. Do you see 
a fold? This gives the idea of a line segment. It 
has two end points A and B. 


Take a thin thread. Hold its two ends and 
stretch it without a slack. It represents a line 
segment. The ends held by hands are the end 
points of the line segment.

BASIC GEOMETRICAL IDEAS 

The following are some models for a line segment : 

An edge of 
a box A tube light The edge of a post card 
Try to find more examples for line 
segments from your surroundings. 

Mark any two points A and B on a sheet 
of paper. Try to connect A to B by all possible 
routes. (Fig 4.1) 

What is the shortest route from A to B? 
This shortest join of point A to B 

(including A and B) shown here is a line 
segment. It is denoted by AB or BA . The points A and B are called the end 
points of the segment. 

A 
B

1. Name the line segments in the figure 4.2. 
Is A, the end point of each line segment? 
Fig 4.2 
4.4 A Line 
Imagine that the line segment from A to B (i.e. AB ) is extended beyond A 
in one direction and beyond B in the other 
direction without any end (see figure). You 
now get a model for a line. 


Do you think you can draw a complete picture of a line? No. (Why?) 

... 


A line through two points A and B is written as AB . It extends 
indefinitely in both directions. So it contains a 


countless number of points. (Think about this). 
Two points are enough to fix a line. We say ‘two 
points determine a line’. 
The adjacent diagram (Fig 4.3) is that of a line

4.5 Intersecting Lines 
Look at the diagram (Fig 4.4). Two lines l1 and l2 
are shown. Both the lines pass through point 

P.We say l1 and l2 intersect at P. If two lines 
have one common point, they are called 
intersecting lines.

The following are some models of a pair of 
intersecting lines (Fig 4.5) :

MATHEMATICS 


The following are some models for a ray : 

A ray is a portion of a line. It starts at one point (called starting point) 
and goes endlessly in a direction. 

Look at the diagram (Fig 4.7) of ray shown here. Two 
points are shown on the ray. They are (a) A, the starting 
point (b) P, a point on the path of the ray. 


We denote it by AP

4.8 Curves 
Have you ever taken a piece of paper and just doodled? The pictures that 

are results of your doodling are called curves. 
(v) (vi) (vii) 
Fig 4.10 

75 

MATHEMATICS 


You can draw some of these drawings without lifting the pencil from the 
paper and without the use of a ruler. These are all curves (Fig 4.10). 
‘Curve’ in everyday usage means “not straight”. In Mathematics, a curve 
can be straight like the one shown in fig 4.10 (iv). 

Observe that the curves (iii) and (vii) in Fig 4.10 cross themselves, 
whereas the curves (i), (ii), (v) and (vi) in Fig 4.10 do not. If a curve does 
not cross itself, then it is called a simple curve. 

Draw five more simple curves and five curves that are not simple. 
Consider these now (Fig 4.11). 

What is the difference between these 
two? The first i.e. Fig 4.11 (i) is an 
open curve and the second i.e. Fig 4.11(ii) 
is a closed curve. Can you identify some 
closed and open curves from the figures 
Fig 4.10 (i), (ii), (v), (vi)? Draw five curves 


each that are open and closed. Fig 4.11 

Position in a figure 

A court line in a tennis court divides it into three parts : inside the line, on the 
line and outside the line. You cannot enter inside without crossing the line. 

A compound wall separates your house 
from the road. You talk about ‘inside’ the 
compound, ‘on’ the boundary of the 
compound and ‘outside’ the compound. 

In a closed curve, thus, there are three parts. 

(i) interior (‘inside’) of the curve 
(ii) boundary (‘on’) of the curve and 
(iii) exterior (‘outside’) of the curve. 
In the figure 4.12, A is in the interior, C is in the exterior and B is on 
the curve. 
The interior of a curve together with its boundary is called its “region”. 

4.9 Polygons 
Look at these figures 4.13 (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v).

BASIC GEOMETRICAL IDEAS 

What can you say? Are they closed? How does each one of them differ 
from the other? (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) are special because they are made up 
entirely of line segments. They are called polygons. 

So, a figure is a polygon if it is a simple closed figure made up entirely 
of line segments. Draw ten differently shaped polygons. 

DoThis
Try to form a polygon with 

1. Five matchsticks. 
2. Four matchsticks. 
3. Three matchsticks. 
4. Two matchsticks. 
In which case was it not possible? Why? 
Sides, vertices and diagonals 

Fig 4.14 

Examine the figure given here (Fig 4.14). 

Give justification to call it a polygon. 

The line segments forming a polygon are called its sides. 

What are the sides of polygon ABCDE? (Note how the corners are named 
in order.) 

Sides are AB, BC, CD, DE and EA . 

The meeting point of a pair of sides is called its vertex. 

Sides AE and ED meet at E, so E is a vertex of the polygon ABCDE. 
Points B and C are its other vertices. Can you name the sides that meet at 
these points? 

Can you name the other vertices of the above polygon ABCDE? 

Any two sides with a common end point are called the adjacent sides of 
the polygon. 

Are the sides AB and BC adjacent? How about AE and DC ? 

The end points of the same side of a polygon are called the adjacent 
vertices. Vertices E and D are adjacent, whereas vertices A and D are not 
adjacent vertices. Do you see why? 

Consider the pairs of vertices which are not 
adjacent. The joins of these vertices are called the 
diagonals of the polygon. 

In the figure 4.15, AC, AD, BD , BE and CE are 
diagonals. 

Is BC a diagonal, Why or why not? 

77 
Fig 4.15 

MATHEMATICS 

If you try to join adjacent vertices, will the result be a diagonal? 

Name all the sides, adjacent sides, adjacent vertices of the figure ABCDE 
(Fig 4.15). 

Draw a polygon ABCDEFGH and name all the sides, adjacent sides and 
vertices as well as the diagonals of the polygon.

diagram: 
(a) A closed curve that is not a polygon. 
(b) An open curve made up entirely of line segments. 
(c) A polygon with two sides. 
4.10 Angles 
Angles are made when corners 
are formed. 

Here is a picture (Fig 4.16) 
where the top of a box is like a 
hinged lid. The edges AD of the 
box and AP of the door can be 

imagined as two rays AD 
. 
and 
.... 


AP . These two rays have a common end point A. The two rays here together 
are said to form an angle. 
An angle is made up of two rays starting from a common end point. 
The two rays forming the angle are called the arms or sides of the angle. 

78 

The common end point is the vertex of the angle. 


Fig 4.16 


BASIC GEOMETRICAL IDEAS

..... 


This is an angle formed by rays OP and OQ 
(Fig 4.17). To show this we use a small curve at 
the vertex. (see Fig 4.17). O is the vertex. What 

..... 


are the sides? Are they not OP and OQ ? 
How can we name this angle? We can simply say 
that it is an angle at O. To be more specific we 
identify some two points, one on each side and the 

vertex to name the angle. Angle POQ is thus a 

better way of naming the angle. We denote this 

by 
.
POQ . 

Think, discuss and write 

Look at the diagram (Fig 4.18).What is the name 

of the angle? Shall we say 
.
P ? But then which 

one do we mean? By

P what do we mean? 

Is naming an angle by vertex helpful here? 

Why not? 

By 
.
P we may mean 
.
APB or

CPB or even

APC ! We need more information. 

Note that in specifying the angle, the vertex is always written as the 
middle letter.

The portion common to both shadings is 
called the interior of

ABC (Fig 4.19). (Note 
that the interior is not a restricted area; it 
extends indefinitely since the two sides extend 
indefinitely). 

Fig 4.19 


In this diagram (Fig 4.20), X is in the 
interior of the angle, Z is not in the interior but 
in the exterior of the angle; and S is on the

A triangle is a three-sided polygon. 
In fact, it is the polygon with the least 
number of sides.

P is in the interior of the triangle, R is in 
the exterior and Q on the triangle.

4.13 Circles 
In our environment, you find many things that are round, a wheel, a bangle, 
a coin etc. We use the round shape in many ways. It is easier to roll a heavy 
steel tube than to drag it. 
A circle is a simple closed curve which is not a polygon. It has some very 
special properties. 

DoThis
.
Place a bangle or any round shape; trace around to get a circular shape. 
.
If you want to make a circular garden, how will you proceed? 
Take two sticks and a piece of 

rope. Drive one stick into the ground. 

This is the centre of the proposed 

circle. Form two loops, one at each 

end of the rope. Place one loop 


around the stick at the centre. Put the 

other around the other stick. Keep the sticks vertical to the ground. Keep 

the rope taut all the time and trace the path. You get a circle. 

Naturally every point on the circle is at equal distance from the centre. 

Parts of a circle 

Here is a circle with centre C (Fig 4.24) 


A, P, B, M are points on the circle. You will see that 
CA = CP = CB = CM. 
Each of the segments CA , CP , CB , CM is 
radius of the circle. The radius is a line segment that 
connects the centre to a point on the circle. CP and 
CM are radii (plural of ‘radius’) such that C, P, M 
are in a line. PM is known as diameter of the circle. 
Is a diameter double the size of a radius? Yes. 

Fig 4.24 


PB is a chord connecting two points on a circle. 
Is PM also a chord? 

An arc is a portion of circle. 

If P and Q are two points you get the arc PQ. We 

write it as PQ (Fig 4.25). 


As in the case of any simple closed curve you can 

Fig 4.25

think of the interior and exterior of a circle. A region 
in the interior of a circle enclosed by an arc on one

side and a pair of radii on the other two sides is 
called a sector (Fig 4.26). 

A region in the interior of a circle enclosed by 
a chord and an arc is called a segment of the circle. 

Take any circular object. Use a thread and 
wrap it around the object once. The length of the 
thread is the distance covered to travel around the 
object once. What does this length denote? 

The distance around a circle is its circumference.

Take a circular sheet. Fold it into two halves. Crease 
the fold and open up. Do you find that the circular 
region is halved by the diameter? 
A diameter of a circle divides it into two equal parts; 
each part is a semi-circle. A semi-circle is half of a circle, 
with the end points of diameter as part of the boundary.

(iii) The meeting point of a pair of sides is called a vertex. 
(iv) The end points of the same side are adjacent vertices. 
(v) The join of any two non-adjacent vertices is a diagonal. 
11. An angle is made up of two rays starting from a common end point.

14. A circle is the path of a point moving at the same distance from a fixed point. 
The fixed point is the centre, the fixed distance is the radius and the distance 
around the circle is the circumference. 
A chord of a circle is a line segment joining any two points on the circle. 
A diameter is a chord passing through the centre of the circle. 
A sector is the region in the interior of a circle enclosed by an arc on one side 

and a pair of radii on the other two sides. 

A segment of a circle is a region in the interior of the circle enclosed by an arc 
and a chord.

5.1 Introduction 
Capthr5Chapter 5 
UndestanigUnersndinUnderstandingUnderstandingUnderstanding 
ElenarEementryElementaryElementaryElementary 
SapesShapsShapesShapesShapes 
All the shapes we see around us are formed using curves or lines. We can see 
corners, edges, planes, open curves and closed curves in our surroundings. 
We organise them into line segments, angles, triangles, polygons and circles. 
We find that they have different sizes and measures. Let us now try to develop 
tools to compare their sizes. 

5.2 Measuring Line Segments 
We have drawn and seen so many line segments. A triangle is made of three, 
a quadrilateral of four line segments. 

A line segment is a fixed portion of a line. This makes it possible to measure 
a line segment. This measure of each line segment is a unique number called 
its “length”. We use this idea to compare line segments. 

To compare any two line segments, we find a relation between their lengths. 
This can be done in several ways. 

(i) Comparison by observation: 
By just looking at them can you 
tell which one is longer? 

You can see that AB is 
longer. 


But you cannot always be 
sure about your usual judgment. 

For example, look at the 
adjoining segments : 



UNDERSTANDING ELEMENTARY SHAPES 

The difference in lengths between these two may not be obvious. This 
makes other ways of comparing necessary. 

In this adjacent figure, AB and PQ have the same 
lengths. This is not quite obvious. 

So, we need better methods of comparing line 
segments. 

(ii) Comparison by Tracing 
To compare AB and CD , we use a tracing paper, trace CD and place the 

traced segment on AB . 

Can you decide now which one among AB and CD is longer? 

The method depends upon the accuracy in tracing the line segment. 
Moreover, if you want to compare with another length, you have to trace 
another line segment. This is difficult and you cannot trace the lengths 
everytime you want to compare them. 

(iii) Comparison using Ruler and a Divider 
Have you seen or can you recognise all the instruments in your 
instrument box? Among other things, you have a ruler and a divider. 


Ruler 

Divider 

Note how the ruler is marked along one of its edges. 

1 mm is 0.1 cm. 

It is divided into 15 parts. Each of these 15 parts is of 

2 mm is 0.2 cm and so on . 

length 1cm. 

2.3 cm will mean 2 cm 
Each centimetre is divided into 10subparts. 

and 3 mm. 

Each subpart of the division of a cm is 1mm. 
How many millimetres 
make one centimetre? Since 
1cm = 10 mm, how will we 


write 2 cm? 3mm? What do we 
mean by 7.7 cm? 
Place the zero mark of the ruler at A. Read the mark against B. This gives 

the length of AB . Suppose the length is 5.8 cm, we may write, 
Length AB = 5.8 cm or more simply as AB = 5.8 cm. 
There is room for errors even in this procedure. The thickness of the ruler 

may cause difficulties in reading off the marks on it. 

87 

MATHEMATICS 

Think, discuss and write 

1. What other errors and difficulties might we face? 
2. What kind of errors can occur if viewing the mark on the ruler is not 
proper? How can one avoid it? 
Open the divider. Place the end point of 
one of its arms at A and the end point of the 
second arm at B. Taking care that opening of 
the divider is not disturbed, lift the divider and 
place it on the ruler. Ensure that one end point 
is at the zero mark of the ruler. Now read the 
mark against the other end point. 


EXERCISE 5.1 

1. What is the disadvantage in comparing line 
segments by mere observation? 
2. Why is it better to use a divider than a ruler, while measuring the length of a line 
segment? 
3. Draw any line segment, say AB . Take any point C lying in between A and B. 
Measure the lengths of AB, BC and AC. Is AB = AC + CB? 
[Note : If A,B,C are any three points on a line such that AC + CB = AB, then we 
can be sure that C lies between A and B.] 

88 

1. Take any post card. Use 
the above technique to 
measure its two 
adjacent sides. 
2. Select any three objects 
having a flat top. 
Measure all sides of the 
top using a divider and 
a ruler. 

UNDERSTANDING ELEMENTARY SHAPES 

4. If A,B,C are three points on a line such that AB = 5 cm, BC = 3 cm and 
AC = 8 cm, which one of them lies between the other two? 
5. Verify, whether D is the mid point of AG . 
6. If B is the mid point of AC and C is the mid 
point of BD , where A,B,C,D lie on a straight line, say why AB = CD? 
7. Draw five triangles and measure their sides. Check in each case, if the sum of 
the lengths of any two sides is always less than the third side. 
5.3 Angles – ‘Right’ and ‘Straight’ 
You have heard of directions in Geography. We know that China is to the 
north of India, Sri Lanka is to the south. We also know that Sun rises in the 
east and sets in the west. There are four main directions. They are North (N), 
South (S), East (E) and West (W). 

Do you know which direction is opposite to north? 

Which direction is opposite to west? 

Just recollect what you know already. We now use this knowledge to learn 
a few properties about angles. 

Stand facing north. 


DoThis
Turn clockwise to east. 
We say, you have turned through a right angle. 

Follow this by a ‘right-angle-turn’, clockwise. 
You now face south. 
If you turn by a right angle in the anti-clockwise 
direction, which direction will you face? It is east 
again! (Why?) 
Study the following positions : 
You stand facing By a ‘right-angle-turn’ By another 
north clockwise, you now ‘right-angle-turn’ you 
face east finally face south. 

89 

MATHEMATICS 

From facing north to facing south, you have turned 
by two right angles. Is not this the same as a single turn 
by two right angles? 

The turn from north to east is by a right angle. 

The turn from north to south is by two right angles; it 
is called a straight angle. (NS is a straight line!) 


Stand facing south. 
Turn by a straight angle. 

Which direction do you face now? 

You face north! 

To turn from north to south, you took a straight angle 
turn, again to turn from south to north, you took another 
straight angle turn in the same direction. Thus, turning by 
two straight angles you reach your original position. 

Think, discuss and write 

By how many right angles should you turn in the same direction to reach your 
original position? 

Turning by two straight angles (or four right angles) in the same direction 
makes a full turn. This one complete turn is called one revolution. The angle 
for one revolution is a complete angle. 

We can see such revolutions on clock-faces. When the 
hand of a clock moves from one position to another, it turns 
through an angle. 

Suppose the hand of a clock starts at 12 and goes round 
until it reaches at 12 again. Has it not made one revolution? 
So, how many right angles has it moved? Consider these 
examples : 


From 12 to 6 From 6 to 9 From 1 to 10 
1 
of a revolution. 
21

5.4 Angles – ‘Acute’, ‘Obtuse’ and 
‘Reflex’ 
We saw what we mean by a right angle and 
a straight angle. However, not all the angles 
we come across are one of these two kinds. 
The angle made by a ladder with the wall 
(or with the floor) is neither a right angle 
nor a straight angle. 


Think, discuss and write 

Are there angles smaller than a right angle? 
Are there angles greater than a right angle? 
Have you seen a carpenter’s square? It looks like the letter 
“L” of English alphabet. He uses it to check right angles. 
Let us also make a similar ‘tester’ for a right angle.

Suppose any shape with corners is given. You can use your RA tester to 
test the angle at the corners. 

Do the edges match with the angles of a paper? If yes, it indicates a 
right angle.

Is the revolution of the hour hand more than 
1 right angle? 


2. What does the angle made by the hour hand of the clock 
look like when it moves from 5 to 7. Is the angle moved 
more than 1 right angle?

them with your tester and tabulate your results for each case :

An angle smaller than a right angle is called an acute angle. These are 
93 
acute angles. 

MATHEMATICS 

Do you see that each one of them is less than one-fourth of a revolution? 
Examine them with your RA tester. 

..
If an angle is larger than a right angle, but less than a straight angle, it is 
called an obtuse angle. These are obtuse angles. 
Do you see that each one of them is greater than 
one-fourth of a revolution but less than half a revolution? 
Your RA tester may help to examine. 
Identify the obtuse angles in the previous examples too.

2. Classify each one of the following angles as right, straight, acute, obtuse or reflex : 
5.5 Measuring Angles 
The improvised ‘Right-angle tester’ we made is helpful to compare angles 
with a right angle. We were able to classify the angles as acute, obtuse or 
reflex. 

But this does not give a precise comparison. It cannot find which one among 
the two obtuse angles is greater. So in order to be more precise in comparison, 
we need to ‘measure’ the angles. We can do it with a ‘protractor’. 

The measure of angle 

We call our measure, ‘degree measure’. One complete revolution is divided 
into 360 equal parts. Each part is a degree. We write 360° to say ‘three hundred 
sixty degrees’. 

Think, discuss and write 

How many degrees are there in half a revolution? In one right angle? In one 
straight angle? 
How many right angles make 180°? 360°? 

DoThis
1. Cut out a circular shape using a bangle or 
take a circular sheet of about the same size. 
2. Fold it twice to get a shape as 
shown. This is called a 
quadrant. 
3. Open it out. You will find a 
semi-circle with a fold in the 
middle. Mark 90o on the fold. 
95 

MATHEMATICS 

4. Fold the semicircle to reach the quadrant. 
Now fold the quadrant once more as 
shown. The angle is half of 90o i.e. 45o. 
5. Open it out now. Two folds appear on each side. What 
is the angle upto the first new line? Write 45o on the 
first fold to the left of the base line. 
6. The fold on the other side would be 90o + 45o = 135o 
7. Fold the paper again upto 45° (half of the 
fold to the left of the base line now is half of 


1o 


45° i.e. 22 . The angle on the left of 135o

protractor. 

The Protractor 

You can find a readymade protractor 
in your ‘instrument box’. The curved 
edge is divided into 180 equal parts. 
Each part is equal to a ‘degree’. The 
markings start from 0° on the right side 
and ends with 180° on the left side, and 
vice-versa.

lines (or line segments). The English alphabet T is one. Is there any other 
alphabet which illustrates perpendicularity? 

Consider the edges of a post card. Are the edges 
perpendicular? 

Let AB be a line segment. Mark its mid point 

as M. Let MN be a line perpendicular to AB 
through M. 
Does MN divide AB into two equal parts? 
MN bisects AB (that is, divides AB into two 


equal parts) and is also perpendicular to AB . 
So we say MN is the perpendicular bisector of AB .

MATHEMATICS 


Take some more 
triangles and verify these. 
For this we will again 
have to measure all the 
sides and angles of the 
triangles. 

The triangles have 
been divided into 
categories and given 
special names. Let us see 
what they are. 


Naming triangles based on sides 
A triangle having all three unequal sides is called a Scalene Triangle [(c), (e)]. 
A triangle having two equal sides is called an Isosceles Triangle [(b), (f)]. 
A triangle having three equal sides is called an Equilateral Triangle [(a), (d)]. 
Classify all the triangles whose sides you measured earlier, using these 

definitions. 

Naming triangles based on angles 

If each angle is less than 90°, then the triangle is called an acute angled triangle. 
If any one angle is a right angle then the triangle is called a right angled 
triangle. 
If any one angle is greater than 90°, then the triangle is called an obtuse 
angled triangle. 


Name the triangles whose angles were measured earlier according to these 
three categories. How many were right angled triangles?

in measure. Can you identify the regular quadrilateral? 
5.9 Polygons 
So far you studied polygons of 3 or 4 sides (known as triangles and 
quardrilaterals respectively). We now try to extend the idea of polygon to 

figures with more number of sides. We may classify polygons according to 
the number of their sides.

UNDERSTANDING ELEMENTARY SHAPES 


You can find many of these shapes in everyday life. Windows, doors, walls, 
almirahs, blackboards, notebooks are all usually rectanglular in shape. Floor 
tiles are rectangles. The sturdy nature of a triangle makes it the most useful 
shape in engineering constructions. 


Look around and see where you can find all these shapes.

5. A diagonal is a line segment that joins any two vertices of the polygon and is not 
a side of the polygon. Draw a rough sketch of a pentagon and draw its diagonals. 
5.10 Three Dimensional Shapes 
Here are a few shapes you see in your day-to-day life. Each shape is a solid. It 
is not a‘flat’ shape.

UNDERSTANDING ELEMENTARY SHAPES 

Name any five things which resemble a sphere. 
Name any five things which resemble a cone. 

Faces, edges and vertices 

In case of many three dimensional shapes we can distinctly identify their 
faces, edges and vertices. What do we mean by these terms: Face, Edge and 
Vertex? (Note ‘Vertices’ is the plural form of ‘vertex’). 

Consider a cube, for example. 
Each side of the cube is a flat surface called a flat face (or simply a face). Two 
faces meet at a line segment called an edge. Three edges meet at a point called 
a vertex. 

Here is a diagram of a prism. 
Have you seen it in the laboratory? One of its 
faces is a triangle. So it is called a triangular 
prism. 
The triangular face is also known as its base. 
A prism has two identical bases; the other faces 
are rectangles. 

If the prism has a rectangular base, it is a rectangular prism. Can you recall 
another name for a rectangular prism? 


A pyramid is a shape with a single base; the other faces are 
triangles. 

Here is a square pyramid. Its base is a square. Can you imagine 
a triangular pyramid? Attempt a rough sketch of it. 


The cylinder, the cone and the sphere have no straight edges. What is the 
base of a cone? Is it a circle? The cylinder has two bases. What shapes are 
they? Of course, a sphere has no flat faces! Think about it.

(c) A match box? (d) A road-roller? 
(e) A sweet laddu? 
What have we discussed? 

1. The distance between the end points of a line segment is its length. 
2. A graduated ruler and the divider are useful to compare lengths of line 
segments. 
3. When a hand of a clock moves from one position to another position we have 
an example for an angle. 
One full turn of the hand is 1 revolution. 
A right angle is ¼ revolution and a straight angle is ½ a revolution . 
We use a protractor to measure the size of an angle in degrees. 
The measure of a right angle is 90° and hence that of a straight angle is 180°. 
An angle is acute if its measure is smaller than that of a right angle and is obtuse 
if its measure is greater than that of a right angle and less than a straight angle. 
A reflex angle is larger than a straight angle. 

111

4. Two intersecting lines are perpendicular if the angle between them is 90°. 
5. The perpendicular bisector of a line segment is a perpendicular to the line 
segment that divides it into two equal parts.

Nature of angles in the triangle Name 
Each angle is acute 
One angle is a right angle 
One angle is obtuse 
Acute angled triangle

6.1 Introduction 
pther6Chapter 6 
InteerItegrsIntegersIntegersIntegers 
Sunita’s mother has 8 bananas. Sunita has to 
go for a picnic with her friends. She wants to 

carry 10 bananas with her. Can her mother 
give 10 bananas to her? She does not have 
enough, so she borrows 2 bananas from her 
neighbour to be returned later. After giving 
10 bananas to Sunita, how many bananas are 
left with her mother? Can we say that she has 
zero bananas? She has no bananas with her, 
but has to return two to her neighbour. So 


when she gets some more bananas, say 6, she 
will return 2 and be left with 4 only. 

Ronald goes to the market to purchase a pen. He has only Rs 12 with him 
but the pen costs Rs 15. The shopkeeper writes Rs 3 as due amount from him. 
He writes Rs 3 in his diary to remember Ronald’s debit. But how would he 
remember whether Rs 3 has to be given or has to be taken from Ronald? Can 
he express this debit by some colour or sign? 

Ruchika and Salma are playing a game using a number strip which is 
marked from 0 to 25 at equal intervals. 


To begin with, both of them placed a coloured token at the zero mark. Two 
coloured dice are placed in a bag and are taken out by them one by one. If the 
die is red in colour, the token is moved forward as per the number shown on 
throwing this die. If it is blue, the token is moved backward as per the number 


MATHEMATICS 


shown when this die is thrown. The dice are put back into the bag after each 
move so that both of them have equal chance of getting either die. The one 
who reaches the 25th mark first is the winner. They play the game. Ruchika 
gets the red die and gets four on the die after throwing it. She, thus, moves the 
token to mark four on the strip. Salma also happens to take out the red die and 
wins 3 points and, thus, moves her token to number 3. 

In the second attempt, Ruchika secures three points with the red die and 
Salma gets 4 points but with the blue die. Where do you think both of them 
should place their token after the second attempt? 

Ruchika moves forward and reaches 4 + 3 i.e. the 7th mark. 


Whereas Salma placed her token at zero position. But Ruchika objected 
saying she should be behind zero. Salma agreed. But there is nothing behind 
zero. What can they do? 

Salma and Ruchika then extended the strip on the other side. They used a 
blue strip on the other side. 


Now, Salma suggested that she is one mark behind zero, so it can be marked 
as blue one. If the token is at blue one, then the position behind blue one is 
blue two. Similarly, blue three is behind blue two. In this way they decided to 
move backward. Another day while playing they could not find blue paper, so 
Ruchika said, let us use a sign on the other side as we are moving in opposite 
direction. So you see we need to use a sign going for numbers less than zero. 
The sign that is used is the placement of a minus sign attached to the number. 
This indicates that numbers with a negative sign are less than zero. These are 
called negative numbers. 

DoThis
(Who is where?) 

Suppose David and Mohan have started walking from zero position in 
opposite directions. Let the steps to the right of zero be represented by ‘+’ 
sign and to the left of zero represented by ‘–’ sign. If Mohan moves 5 steps 
to the right of zero it can be represented as +5 and if David moves 5 steps to 

114 


INTEGERS 

the left of zero it can be represented as – 5. Now represent the following 
positions with + or – sign : 

(a) 8 steps to the left of zero. (b) 7 steps to the right of zero. 
(c) 11 steps to the right of zero. (d) 6 steps to the left of zero. 
DoThis
(Who follows me?) 

We have seen from the previous examples that a movement to the right is 
made if the number by which we have to move is positive. If a movement of 
only 1 is made we get the successor of the number. 
Write the succeeding number of the following : 

Number Successor 
10 
8 
– 5 
– 3 
0 

A movement to the left is made if the number by which the token has to 
move is negative. 

If a movement of only 1 is made to the left, we get the predecessor of a 
number. 


Now write the preceding number of the following : 

Number Predecessor 
10 
8 
5 
3 
0 

6.1.1 Tag me with a sign 
We have seen that some numbers carry a minus sign. For example, if we want 
to show Ronald’s due amount to the shopkeeper we would write it as – 3. 

115 

MATHEMATICS 

Following is an account of a shopkeeper which shows profit 
and loss from the sale of certain items. Since profit and loss 
are opposite situations and if profit is represented by ‘+’ sign, 
loss can be represented by ‘–’ sign. 
Some of the situations where we may use these signs are : 


Name of items Profit Loss Representation 
with proper sign 
Mustard oil Rs 150 .............................. 
Rice Rs 250 .............................. 
Black pepper Rs 225 .............................. 
Wheat Rs 200 .............................. 
Groundnut oil Rs 330 .............................. 

The height of a place above sea level is denoted by a positive number. Height 
becomes lesser and lesser as we go lower and lower. Thus, below the surface 
of the sea level we can denote the height by a negative number. 

If earnings are represented by ‘+’ sign, 
then the spendings may be shown by a 
‘–’ sign. Similarly, temperature above 
0°C is denoted a ‘+’ sign and temperature 
below 0°C is denoted by ‘–’ sign. 
For example, the temperature of a place 
10° below 0°C is written as –10°C. 

Write the following numbers with 
appropriate signs : 
(a) 100 m below sea level. 
(b) 25°C above 0°C temperature. 
(c) 15°C below 0°C temperature. 
(d) any five numbers less than 0. 
6.2 Integers 
The first numbers to be discovered were natural numbers i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4,... If 
we include zero to the collection of natural numbers, we get a new collection 
of numbers known as whole numbers i.e. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,... You have studied 
these numbers in the earlier chapter. Now we find that there are negative 
numbers too. If we put the whole numbers and the negative numbers together, 
the new collection of numbers will look like 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,..., –1, – 2, – 3, 
–4, –5, ... and this collection of numbers is known as Integers. In this 
collection, 1, 2, 3, ... are said to be positive integers and – 1, – 2, – 3,.... are 
said to be negative integers. 

116 


INTEGERS 

Let us understand this by the following figures. Let us suppose that the 
figures represent the collection of numbers written against them. 


Natural numbers 


Zero 

Whole numbers 


Negative numbers 


Integers 

Then the collection of integers can be understood by the following diagram 
in which all the earlier collections are included : 

Integers 
6.2.1 Representation of integers on a number line 
Draw a line and mark some points at equal distance on it as shown in the 
figure. Mark a point as zero on it. Points to the right of zero are positive 
integers and are marked + 1, + 2, + 3, etc. or simply 1, 2, 3 etc. Points to the 
left of zero are negative integers and are marked – 1, – 2, – 3 etc. 
In order to mark – 6 on this line, we move 6 points to the left of zero. (Fig 6.1) 


In order to mark + 2 on the number line, we move 2 points to the right of 
zero. (Fig 6.2)

6.2.2 Ordering of integers 
Raman and Imran live in a village where there is a step 
well. There are in all 25 steps down to the bottom of 
the well. 

One day Raman and Imran went to the well and 
counted 8 steps down to water level. They 


decided to see how much water would come 
in the well during rains. They marked zero at 
the existing level of water and marked 
1,2,3,4,... above that level for each step. After 
the rains they noted that the water level rose 
up to the sixth step. After a few months, they 


Mark –3, 7, –4, 
–8, –1 and – 3 on 
the number line. 
noticed that the water level had fallen three steps below the zero mark. Now, 
they started thinking about marking the steps to note the fall of water level. 
Can you help them? 

Suddenly, Raman remembered that at one big dam he saw numbers marked 
even below zero. Imran pointed out that there should be some way to distinguish 
between numbers which are above zero and below zero. 


Then Raman recalled that the numbers which were below 
zero had minus sign in front of them. So they marked one 
step below zero as – 1 and two steps below zero as – 2 
and so on. 

So the water level is now at – 3 (3 steps below zero). 

After that due to further use, the water level went down 

by 1 step and it was at – 4. You can see that – 4 < – 3. 

Keeping in mind the above example, fill in the boxes using > and < signs. 


0 – 1 – 100 –101 
– 50 – 70 50 –51 
– 53 – 5 – 7 1 

118 


INTEGERS 

Let us once again observe the integers which are represented on the 
number line. 


We know that 7 > 4 and from the number line shown above, we observe 
that 7 is to the right of 4 (Fig 6.3). 

Similarly, 4 > 0 and 4 is to the right of 0. Now, since 0 is to the right of 
–3 so, 0 > – 3. Again, – 3 is to the right of – 8 so, – 3 > – 8. 

Thus, we see that on a number line the number increases as we move to 
the right and decreases as we move to the left. 

Therefore, – 3 < – 2, – 2 < – 1, – 1 < 0, 0 < 1, 1 < 2, 2 < 3 so on. 

Hence, the collection of integers can be written as..., –5, –4, – 3, – 2, – 1, 
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... 

Compare the following pairs of numbers using > or <. 
0 – 8; – 1 – 15 
5 – 5; 11 15 
0 6; – 20 2 
From the above exercise, Rohini arrived at the following conclusions : 
(a) Every positive integer is larger than every negative integer. 
(b) Zero is less than every positive integer. 
(c) Zero is larger than every negative integer. 
(d) Zero is neither a negative integer nor a positive integer. 
(e) Farther a number from zero on the right, larger is its value. 
(f) Farther a number from zero on the left, smaller is its value. 
Do you agree with her? Give examples. 
Example 1 : By looking at the number line, answer the following questions : 
Which integers lie between – 8 and – 2? Which is the largest integer and the 
smallest integer among them? 

Solution : Integers between – 8 and – 2 are – 7, – 6, – 5, – 4, – 3. The integer 

– 3 is the largest and – 7 is the smallest. 
If, I am not at zero what happens when I move? 

Let us consider the earlier game being played by Salma and Ruchika. 

119 

MATHEMATICS 

Suppose Ruchika’s token is at 2. At the next turn she gets a red die which after 
throwing gives a number 3. It means she will move 3 places to the right of 2. 

Thus, she comes to 5. 


If on the other hand, Salma was at 1, and drawn a blue die which gave her 
number 3, then it means she will move to the left by 3 places and stand at – 2. 
By looking at the number line, answer the following question : 

Example 2 : (a) One button is kept at – 3. In which direction and how many 
steps should we move to reach at – 9? 

(b) Which number will we reach if we move 4 steps to the right of – 6. 
Solution : (a) We have to move six steps to the left of – 3. 
(b) We reach – 2 when we move 4 steps to the right of – 6.

In Mohan’s house, there are stairs for going up to the terrace and for going

2 A Game 
Take a number strip marked with integers from + 25 to – 25. 


Take two dice, one marked 1 to 6 and the other marked with three ‘+’ signs 
and three ‘–’ signs. 

Players will keep 
different coloured buttons 
(or plastic counters) at the 
zero position on the 
number strip. In each 
throw, the player has to see 
what she has obtained on the two dice. If the first die shows 3 and the second 
die shows – sign, she has –3. If the first die shows 5 and the second die 
shows ‘+’ sign, then, she has +5. 

Whenever a player gets the + sign, she has to move in the forward direction 
(towards + 25) and if she gets ‘–’ sign then she has to move in the backward 
direction (towards – 25). 


123 

MATHEMATICS 

Each player will throw 

both dice simultaneously. 

A player whose counter 

touches –25 is out of the 

game and the one whose 

counter touches + 25 first, wins the game. 
You can play the same game with 12 cards marked with + 1, + 2, + 3, + 4, 

+ 5 and + 6 and –1, – 2, ...– 6. Shuffle the cards after every attempt. 
Kamla, Reshma and Meenu are playing this game. 
Kamla got + 3, + 2, + 6 in three successive attempts. She kept her counter 
at the mark +11. 

Reshma got – 5, + 3, + 1. She kept her counter at – 1. Meenu got + 4, – 3, –2 
in three successive attempts; at what position will her counter be? 
At –1 or at + 1? 


DoThis
Take two different coloured buttons like white and black. Let us denote one 
white button by (+ 1) and one black button by (– 1). A pair of one white button 
(+ 1) and one black button (– 1) will denote zero i.e. [1 + (– 1) = 0] 

In the following table, integers are shown with the help of coloured buttons. 


Let us perform additions with the help of the coloured buttons. 
Observe the following table and complete it.

 
+ = ( + 3) + ( + 2) = +5 
+ = 
(– 2) + ( – 1) = –3 
+ = ......................... 
+ = ......................... .........................

INTEGERS 

You add when you have two positive numbers 
like (+3) + (+2) = +5 [= 3 + 2]. You also add when 
you have two negative numbers, but the answer 
will take a minus (–) sign like (–2) + (–1) = 
– (2+1) = –3. 

Now add one positive integer with one negative 
integer with the help of these buttons. Remove 
buttons in pairs i.e. a white button with a black 
button [since (+ 1) + (– 1) = 0]. Check the remaining 
buttons. 

(a) (– 4) + (+ 3) 
Find the answers of the 
following additions: 
(a) (– 11) + (– 12) 
(b) (+ 10) + (+ 4) 
(c) (– 32) + (– 25) 
(d) (+ 23) + (+ 40) 
= (– 1) + (– 3) + (+ 3) 
= (– 1) + 0 = – 1 

(b)(+ 4) + (– 3) 
= (+ 1) + (+ 3) + (– 3) 
= (+ 1) + 0 = + 1 
You can see that the answer of 4 – 3 is 1 and – 4 + 3 is – 1. 


So, when you have one positive and one 
negative integer, you must subtract, but 
answer will take the sign of the bigger 
integer (Ignoring the signs of the 
numbers decide which is bigger). 

Some more examples will help : 

(c)(+ 5) + (– 8) = (+ 5) + (– 5) + (– 3) = 0 + (– 3)
(d)(+ 6) + (– 4) = (+ 2) + (+ 4) + (– 4) = (+ 2) + 0

MATHEMATICS 

(i) Let us add 3 and 5 on number line. 
On the number line, we first move 3 steps to the right from 0 reaching 3, then 
we move 5 steps to the right of 3 and reach 8. Thus, we get 3 + 5 = 8 (Fig 6.4) 

(ii) Let us add – 3 and – 5 on the number line. 
On the number line, we first move 3 steps to the left of 0 reaching – 3, 
then we move 5 steps to the left of – 3 and reach – 8. (Fig 6.5) 
Thus, (– 3) + (– 5) = – 8. 
We observe that when we add two positive integers, their sum is a positive 
integer. When we add two negative integers, their sum is a negative integer. 

(iii) Suppose we wish to find the sum of (+ 5) and (– 3) on the number line. 
First we move to the right of 0 by 5 steps reaching 5. Then we move 
3 steps to the left of 5 reaching 2. (Fig 6.6) 
Thus, (+ 5) + (– 3) = 2 

(iv) Similarly, let us find the sum of (– 5) and (+ 3) on the number line. 
First we move 5 steps to the left of 0 reaching – 5 and then from this 
point we move 3 steps to the right. We reach the point – 2. 
Thus, (– 5) + (+3) = – 2. (Fig 6.7)

INTEGERS 

When a positive integer is 
added to an integer, the resulting 
integer becomes greater than the 
given integer. When a negative 
integer is added to an integer, the 
resulting integer becomes less 
than the given integer. 
Let us add 3 and – 3. We first 
move from 0 to + 3 and then from 
+ 3, we move 3 points to the left. 
Where do we reach ultimately? 
From the Figure 6.8, 
3 + (– 3) = 0. Similarly, if we add 
2 and – 2, we obtain the sum as

additions using a number line :

Make two such questions and solve

without using number line :

zero. Numbers such as 3 and – 3, 2 and – 2, when added to each other give the 
sum zero. They are called additive inverse of each other. 

What is the additive inverse of 6? What is the additive inverse of – 7? 

Example 3 : Using the number line, write the integer which is 

(a) 4 more than –1 

(b) 5 less than 3 

Solution : (a)We want to know the integer which is 4 more than –1. So, we 
start from –1 and proceed 4 steps to the right of –1 to reach 3 as shown below: 


Therefore, 4 more than –1 is 3 (Fig 6.9). 

127 

MATHEMATICS 

(b) We want to know an integer which is 5 less than 3; so we start from 3 and 
move to the left by 5 steps and obtain –2 as shown below : 
Therefore, 5 less than 3 is –2. (Fig 6.10) 

Example 4 : Find the sum of (– 9) + (+ 4) + (– 6) + (+ 3) 

Solution : We can rearrange the numbers so that the positive integers and the 

negative integers are grouped together. We have 
(– 9) + (+ 4) + (– 6) + (+ 3) = (– 9) + (– 6) + (+ 4) + (+ 3) = (– 15) + (+ 7) = – 8 
Example 5 : Find the value of (30) + (– 23) + (– 63) + (+ 55) 
Solution : (30) + (+ 55) + (– 23) + (– 63) = 85 + (– 86) = – 1 
Example 6 : Find the sum of (– 10), (92), (84) and (– 15) 
Solution : (– 10) + (92) + (84) + (– 15) = (– 10) + (– 15) + 92 + 84 
= (– 25) + 176 = 151

5. Find the sum : 
(a) (– 7) + (– 9) + 4 + 16 
(b) (37) + (– 2) + (– 65) + (– 8) 
6.4 Subtraction of Integers with the help of a Number Line 
We have added positive integers on a number line. For example, consider 
6+2. We start from 6 and go 2 steps to the right side. We reach at 8. 
So, 6 + 2 = 8. (Fig 6.11) 


Fig 6.11 

We also saw that to add 6 and (–2) on a number line we can start from 6 and 
then move 2 steps to the left of 6. We reach at 4. So, we have, 6 + (–2) = 4. 
(Fig 6.12) 


Fig 6.12 

Thus, we find that, to add a positive integer we move towards the right on 
a number line and for adding a negative integer we move towards left. 

We have also seen that while using a number line for whole numbers, for 
subtracting 2 from 6, we would move towards left. (Fig 6.13) 


Fig 6.13 

i.e. 6 – 2 = 4 

What would we do for 6 – (–2)? Would we move towards the left on the 
number line or towards the right? 

If we move to the left then we reach 4. 

Then we have to say 6 – (–2) = 4. This is not true because we know 
6 – 2 = 4 and 6 – 2 
.
6 – (–2). 

129 

MATHEMATICS 

So, we have to move towards the right. (Fig 6.14) 


Fig 6.14 

i.e. 6 – (–2) = 8 

This also means that when we subtract a negative integer we get a greater 
integer. Consider it in another way. We know that additive inverse of (–2) is 2. 
Thus, it appears that adding the additive inverse of –2 to 6 is the same as 
subtracting (–2) from 6. 

We write 6 – (–2) = 6 + 2. 

Let us now find the value of –5 – (–4) using a number line. We can say that 
this is the same as –5 + (4), as the additive inverse of –4 is 4. 

We move 4 steps to the right on the number line starting from –5. 
(Fig 6.15) 


Fig 6.15 

We reach at –1. 

i.e. –5 + 4 = –1. Thus, –5 – (–4) = –1. 
Example 7 : Find the value of – 8 – (–10) using number line 
Solution : – 8 – (– 10) is equal to – 8 + 10 as additive inverse of –10 is 10. 
On the number line, from – 8 we will move 10 steps towards right. (Fig 6.16) 


Fig 6.16 

We reach at 2. Thus, –8 – (–10) = 2 

Hence, to subtract an integer from another integer it is enough to add the 
additive inverse of the integer that is being subtracted, to the other integer. 

Example 8 : Subtract (– 4) from (– 10) 

Solution : (– 10) – (– 4) = (– 10) + (additive inverse of – 4) 
= –10 + 4 = – 6 

130 


INTEGERS 

Example 9 : Subtract (+ 3) from (– 3) 

Solution : (– 3) – (+ 3) = (– 3) + (additive inverse of + 3) 
= (– 3) + (– 3) = – 6

(d) 50 – (– 40) – (– 2) 
What have we discussed? 

1. We have seen that there are times when we need to use numbers with a negative 
sign. This is when we want to go below zero on the number line. These are 
called negative numbers. Some examples of their use can be in temperature scale, 
water level in lake or river, level of oil in tank etc. They are also used to denote 
debit account or outstanding dues. 
131 

MATHEMATICS 


2. The collection of numbers..., – 4, – 3, – 2, – 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... is called integers. 
So, – 1, – 2, – 3, – 4, ... called negative numbers are negative integers and 1, 2, 3, 
4, ... called positive numbers are the positive integers. 

3. We have also seen how one more than given number gives a successor and one 
less than given number gives predecessor. 
4. We observe that 
(a) When we have the same sign, add and put the same sign. 
(i) When two positive integers are added, we get a positive integer 
[e.g. (+ 3) + ( + 2) = + 5]. 
(ii) When two negative integers are added, we get a negative integer 
[e.g. (–2) + ( – 1) = – 3]. 
(b) When one positive and one negative integers are added we subtract them and 
put the sign of the bigger integer. The bigger integer is decided by ignoring 
the signs of the integers [e.g. (+4) + (–3) = + 1 and (–4) + ( + 3) = – 1]. 
(c) The subtraction of an integer is the same as the addition of its additive 
inverse. 
5. We have shown how addition and subtraction of integers can also be shown on a 
number line.

7.1 Introduction 
ChapteChapter7CheaptChapter 7 
FractionsFractionsFrctionsraosFractions 
Subhash had learnt about fractions in 
Classes IV and V, so whenever possible 
he would try to use fractions. One 
occasion was when he forgot his lunch 
at home. His friend Farida invited him 
to share her lunch. She had five pooris 
in her lunch box. So, Subhash and 
Farida took two pooris each. Then 
Farida made two equal halves of the 
fifth poori and gave one-half to Subhash 
and took the other half herself. Thus, 
both Subhash and Farida had 2 full 
pooris and one-half poori. 

Where do you come across situations with fractions in 
your life? 


1 

Fig 7.1

Subhash knew that one-half is written as . While 

2 

eating he further divided his half poori into two equal 
parts and asked Farida what fraction of the whole poori 
was that piece? (Fig 7.1) 

Without answering, Farida also divided her portion of the 
half puri into two equal parts and kept them beside Subhash’s 
shares. She said that these four equal parts together make 


Fig 7.2 

2 pooris + half-poori–Subhash 
2 pooris + half-poori–Farida 



.......... 


one whole (Fig 7.2). So, each equal part is one-fourth of one whole poori and 

4 

4 parts together will be or 1 whole poori.

When they ate, they discussed 
what they had learnt earlier. Three

parts out of 4 equal parts is .

Similarly, is obtained when we

divide a whole into seven equal parts 

1 

and take three parts (Fig 7.3). For , we divide a whole into eight equal parts

8 

and take one part out of it (Fig 7.4). 

Farida said that we have learnt that a fraction is a number representing 
part of a whole. The whole may be a single object or a group of objects. 
Subhash observed that the parts have to be equal. 

7.2 A Fraction 
Let us recapitulate the discussion. 
A fraction means a part of a group or of a region.

 is a fraction. We read it as “five-twelfths”. 

12

What does “12” stand for? It is the number of equal parts 
into which the whole has been divided. 
What does “5” stand for? It is the number of equal parts which have been 
taken out. 
Here 5 is called the numerator and 12 is called the denominator.

We can also show fractions on a number line. Let us draw a number line

You have now learnt how to locate fractions on a number line. Locate the 

3 1 9 0 5 
fractions ,, 
4 2 
, 
10 
,3 8 
on separate number lines. 

Does any one of the fractions lie beyond 1? 
All these fractions lie to the left of 1as they are less than 1. 
In fact, all the fractions we have learnt so far are less than 1. These are 

proper fractions. A proper fraction as Farida said (Sec. 7.1), is a number 
representing part of a whole. In a proper fraction the denominator shows the 
number of parts into which the whole is divided and the numerator shows the 
number of parts we have taken out. Therefore, in a proper fraction the numerator 
is always less than the denominator. 

1. Give a proper fraction : 
(a) whose numerator is 5 and denominator is 7. 
(b) whose denominator is 9 and numerator is 5. 
(c) whose numerator and denominator add up to 10. How many fractions 
of this kind can you make? 
(d) whose denominator is 4 more than the numerator. 
(Give any five. How many more can you make?) 
2. A fraction is given. 
How will you decide, by just looking at it, whether, the fraction is 
(a) less than 1? 
(b) equal to 1?

7.5 Improper and Mixed Fractions 
Anagha, Ravi, Reshma and 
John shared their tiffin. Along 
with their food, they had also, 
brought 5 apples. After eating 
the other food, the four friends 
wanted to eat apples. 

How can they share five 
apples among four of them? 


... 



.|...... 


Anagha said, ‘Let each of us have one full apple and a quarter of the fifth 
apple.’ 


Anagha Ravi Reshma John 

Reshma said, ‘That is fine, but we can also divide each of the five apples 
into 4 equal parts and take one-quarter from each apple.’ 


Anagha Ravi Reshma John 

Ravi said, ‘In both the ways of sharing each of us would get the same 
share, i.e., 5 quarters. Since 4 quarters make one whole, we can also say that 
each of us would get 1 whole and one quarter. The value of each share would 

5 

be five divided by four. Is it written as 5 ÷ 4?’ John said, ‘Yes the same as ’. 

4 
5 

Reshma added that in , the numerator is bigger than the denominator. The 

4 

fractions, where the numerator is bigger than the denominator are called 

improper fractions.

Thus, fractions like ,, are all improper fractions.

2. Write five improper fractions with numerator 11. 
Ravi reminded John, ‘What is 
the other way of writing the share? 
Does it follow from Anagha’s way 
of dividing 5 apples?’ 

John nodded, ‘Yes, It indeed

Try (c) and (d) using both the methods for yourself. 
Thus, we can express an improper fraction as a mixed fraction by dividing 
the numerator by denominator to obtain the quotient and the remainder. Then

the mixed fraction will be written as Quotient .

To find an equivalent fraction of a given fraction, you may multiply both 
the numerator and the denominator of the given fraction by the same number.

An interesting fact 

Let us now note an interesting fact about equivalent fractions. For this, complete 
the given table. The first two rows have already been completed for you. 

Equivalent 
fractions 
Product of 
the numerator of the 
1st and the denominator 
of the 2ndProduct of 
the numerator of 
the 2nd and the 
denominator of the 1st 
Are the

What do we infer? The product of the numerator of the first and the 
denominator of the second is equal to the product of denominator of the first 
and the numerator of the second in all these cases. These two products are 
called cross products. Work out the cross products for other pairs of equivalent 
fractions. Do you find any pair of fractions for which cross products are not 
equal? This rule is helpful in finding equivalent fractions.

Example 5 : Find the equivalent fraction of with denominator 63.

Solution : We have = 

9 63 

For this, we should have, 9 × 

= 2 × 63. 
But 63 = 7 × 9, so 9 × 

= 2 × 7 × 9 = 14 × 9 = 9 × 14 
or 9 × 

= 9 × 14

7.7 Simplest Form of a Fraction 
36 

Given the fraction , let us try to get an equivalent fraction in which the

54 

numerator and the denominator have no common factor except 1. 
How do we do it? We see that both 36 and 54 are divisible by 2. 

36 362 18 

.. 


54 542 27 

But 18 and 27 also have common factors other than one. 
The common factors are 1, 3, 9; the highest is 9. 

Therefore, 
18 
27 . 
18 
.
9 
27 
.
9 . 
2 
3 
2 

Now 2 and 3 have no common factor except 1; we say that the fraction 

3 

is in the simplest form. 

A fraction is said to be in the simplest (or lowest) form if its numerator 
and denominator have no common factor except 1. 


The shortest way 

The shortest way to find the 
equivalent fraction in the 
simplest form is to find the 
HCF of the numerator and 
denominator, and then divide 
both of them by the HCF. 

A Game 
The equivalent fractions given here are quite 
interesting. Each one of them uses all the digits 
from 1 to 9 once!

Try to find two more such equivalent fractions.

24 
The HCF of 36 and 24 is 12. 
Therefore, 
36 
24 
=

fraction 
3 
2 
is in the lowest form. 
Thus, HCF helps us to reduce a fraction to 
its lowest form.

Sohni has 3 rotis in her plate and Rita has 2 rotis in her plate. Who has 

24more rotis in her plate? Clearly, Sohni has 3 full rotis and more and Rita has

410 

this, we may wish to show the fractions 
using figures (as in fig. 7.12), but drawing figures may not be easy especially 
with denominators like 13. We should therefore like to have a systematic 
procedure to compare fractions. It is particularly easy to compare like fractions. 
We do this first.

In both the fractions the whole is divided into 8 equal parts. For and ,

88 

we take 3 and 5 parts respectively out of the 8 equal parts. Clearly, out of 8 
equal parts, the portion corresponding to 5 parts is larger than the portion 

53 

corresponding to 3 parts. Hence, > . Note the number of the parts taken is

88 

given by the numerator. It is, therefore, clear that for two fractions with the 
same denominator, the fraction with the greater numerator is greater. Between

purpose, we can use the method of equivalent fractions which we already 
know. Using this method we can change the denominator of a fraction without 
changing its value.

Solution : The fractions are unlike fractions. Their numerators are different 
too. Let us write their equivalent fractions.

The equivalent fractions with the same denominator are :

Note that the common denominator of the equivalent fractions is 30 which 
is 5 × 6. It is a common multiple of both 5 and 6. 

So, when we compare two unlike fractions, we first get their equivalent 
fractions with a denominator which is a common multiple of the denominators 
of both the fractions.

Example 7 : Compare and . 

615 
Solution : The fractions are unlike. We should first get their equivalent fractions 
with a denominator which is a common multiple of 6 and 15.

Why LCM? 

The product of 6 and 15 is 90; obviously 90 is also a common multiple of 
6 and 15. We may use 90 instead of 30; it will not be wrong. But we know that 
it is easier and more convenient to work with smaller numbers. So the common 
multiple that we take is as small as possible. This is why the LCM of the 
denominators of the fractions is preferred as the common denominator.

7.10 Addition and Subtraction of Fractions 
So far in our study we have learnt about natural numbers, whole numbers and 
then integers. In the present chapter, we are learning about fractions, a different 
type of numbers. 

Whenever we come across new type of numbers, we want to know how to 
operate with them. Can we combine and add them? If so, how? Can we take 
away some number from another? i.e., can we subtract one from the other? 
and so on. Which of the properties learnt earlier about the numbers hold now? 
Which are the new properties? We also see how these help us deal with our 
daily life situations. 

...

Look at the following 
example. A tea stall owner 

1 

consumes in her shop 2 

2 

litres of milk in the morning 

1 

and 1 litres of milk in the 

2

evening. What is the total 
amount of milk she uses in 
the stall? 

Or Shekhar ate 2 chapatis 

1 

for lunch and 1 chapatis for 

2

dinner. What is the total 
number of chapatis he ate? 

Clearly, both the situations 
require the fractions to be added. Some of these additions can be done orally 
and the sum can be found quite easily. 

1. My mother divided an apple into 4 equal 
parts. She gave me two parts and my 
brother one part. How much apple did she 
give to both of us together? 
2. Mother asked Neelu and her brother to 
pick stones from the wheat. Neelu picked 
one fourth of the total stones in it and her 
brother also picked up one fourth of the 
stones. What fraction of the stones did both 
pick up together? 
3. Sohan was putting covers on his note books. 
He put one fourth of the covers on Monday. 
He put another one fourth on Tuesday and 
the remaining on Wednesday. What fraction 
of the covers did he put on Wednesday? 
DoThis
Make five such problems with your friends and solve them. 

7.10.1 Adding or subtracting like fractions 
All fractions cannot be added orally. We need to know how they can be added 
in different situations and learn the procedure for it. We begin by looking at 
addition of like fractions. 

Take a 7 × 4 grid sheet (Fig 7.13). The sheet has 
seven boxes in each row and four boxes in each 
column. 

How many boxes are there in total? 
Colour five of its boxes in green. 
What fraction of the whole is the green region? 
Now colour another four of its boxes in yellow. 
What fraction of the whole is this yellow region? 
What fraction of the whole is coloured altogether?

7.10.2 Adding and subtracting fractions 
We have learnt to add and subtract like fractions. It is also not very difficult to 
add fractions that do not have the same denominator. When we have to add or 
subtract fractions we first find equivalent fractions with the same denominator 
and then proceed. 

1 1 1 1 

What added to gives ? This means subtract from to get the

52 52

required number.

Since and are unlike fractions, in order to subtract them, we first find

their equivalent fractions with the same denominator. These are and

How do we add or subtract mixed fractions? 

Mixed fractions can be written either as a whole part plus a proper fraction or 
entirely as an improper fraction. One way to add (or subtract) mixed fractions 
is to do the operation seperately for the whole parts and the other way is to 
write the mixed fractions as improper fractions and then directly add (or 
subtract) them.

What have we discussed? 


1. (a) A fraction is a number representing a part of a whole. The whole may be a 
single object or a group of objects. 
(b) When expressing a situation of counting parts to write a fraction, it must be 
ensured that all parts are equal. 
5 

2. In , 5 is called the numerator and 7 is called the denominator. 
7 

3. Fractions can be shown on a number line. Every fraction has a point associated 
with it on the number line. 
4. In a proper fraction, the numerator is less than the denominator. The fractions, 
where the numerator is greater than the denominator are called improper fractions. 
An improper fraction can be written as a combination of a whole and a part, and 
such fraction then called mixed fractions. 
5. Each proper or improper fraction has many equivalent fractions. To find an 
equivalent fraction of a given fraction, we may multiply or divide both the 
numerator and the denominator of the given fraction by the same number. 
6. A fraction is said to be in the simplest (or lowest) form if its numerator and the 
denominator have no common factor except 1.

Savita and Shama were going to market to buy some stationary items. 
Savita said, “I have 5 rupees and 75 paise”. Shama said, “I have 7 rupees 
and 50 paise”. 

They knew how to write rupees and paise using decimals. 
So Savita said, I have Rs 5.75 and Shama said, 

“I have Rs 7.50”. 
Have they written correctly? 
We know that the dot represents a decimal point. 
In this chapter, we will learn more about working 

with decimals. 

8.2 Tenths 
Ravi and Raju measured the lengths of their pencils. Ravi’s pencil was 
7 cm 5mm long and Raju’s pencil was 8 cm 3 mm long. Can you express 
these lengths in centimetre using decimals? 

We know that 10 mm = 1 cm 

1 

Therefore, 1 mm = cm or one-tenth cm = 0.1 cm 

10

Now, length of Ravi’s pencil= 7cm 5mm 

5 

= 7 cm i.e. 7cm and 5 tenths of a cm 

10 

= 7.5cm 
The length of Raju’s pencil = 8 cm 3 mm 

3 

= 8 cm i.e. 8 cm and 3 tenths of a cm 

10

= 8.3 cm 



....... 


Let us recall what we have learnt earlier. 
If we show units by blocks then one unit is 
one block, two units are two blocks and so 
on. One block divided into 10 equal parts 


1 

means each part is (one-tenth) of a unit, 2 parts show 2 tenths and 5

10

parts show 5 tenths and so on. A combination of 2 blocks and 3 parts 
(tenths) will be recorded as : 

Ones Tenths 
(1) 
1 
( )
10 
2 3 


It can be written as 2.3 and read as two point three. 

Let us look at another example where we have more than ‘ones’. Each 
tower represents 10 units. So, the number shown here is : 

 
Tens Ones Tenths 
(10) (1)
1 
( )
10 
2 3 5 

5 

i.e. 20 + 3 + = 23.5 

10

This is read as ‘twenty three point five’.

Representing Decimals on number line 

We represented fractions on a number line. Let us now represent decimals 
too on a number line. Let us represent 0.6 on a number line. 

We know that 0.6 is more than zero but less than one. There are 6 tenths in 

it. Divide the unit length between 0 and 1 into 10 equal parts and take 6 parts 

as shown below : 


Write five numbers between 0 and 1 and show them on the number line. 

Can you now represent 2.3 on a number line? Check, how many ones and 
tenths are there in 2.3. Where will it lie on the number line? 

Show 1.4 on the number line. 

Example 1 : Write the following numbers in the place value table : (a) 20.5 
(b) 4.2 

Solution : Let us make a common place value table, assigning appropriate place 
value to the digits in the given numbers. We have, 

Tens (10) Ones (1) 
1 
Tenths ( )
10 
20.5 2 0 5 
4.2 0 4 2 

Example 2 : Write each of the following as decimals : (a) Two ones and 
five-tenths (b) Thirty and one-tenth 

5 

Solution : (a) Two ones and five-tenths = 2 + = 2.5 

101 

(b) Thirty and one-tenth = 30 + = 30.1 
10

Example 3 : Write each of the following as decimals : 

28 

(a) 30 + 6 + (b) 600 + 2 +
10 10 
2 

Solution : (a) 30 + 6 + 

10 

How many tens, ones and tenths are there in this number? We have 
3 tens, 6 ones and 2 tenths. 
Therefore, the decimal representation is 36.2. 

8 

(b) 600 + 2 + 

10 

... 


Note that it has 6 hundreds, no tens, 2 ones and 8 tenths. 
Therefore, the decimal representation is 602.8

The decimal point comes between ones place and tenths place in a 
decimal number. 
It is now natural to extend the place value table further, from hundredths to 

1 

of hundredths i.e. thousandths.

(b) Here, we have to find a fraction equivalent to with denominator 10 or 
4

100. There is no whole number that gives 10 on multiplying by 4, therefore, 
we make the demominator 100 and we have, 
3 325 75

8.4 Comparing Decimals 
Can you tell which is greater, 0.07 or 0.1? 

Take two pieces of square papers of the same size. Divide them into 100 
equal parts. For 0.07 we have to shade 7 parts out of 100. 

1 10 

Now, 0.1 = = , so, for 0.1, shade 10 parts out 100.

10100

.

0.07 = 
10 100

100 


This means 0.1>0.07 

Let us now compare the numbers 32.55 and 32.5. In this case , we first 
compare the whole part. We see that the whole part for both the nunbers is 32 
and, hence, equal. 

We, however, know that the two numbers are not equal. So, we now compare 
the tenth part. We find that for 32.55 and 32.5, the tenth part is also equal, then 
we compare the hundredth part. 

... 



....... 


We find, 

55 50 

32.55 = 32 + + and 32.5 = 32 + + , therefore, 32.55>32.5 as
1010010100 

the hundredth part of 32.55 is more. 
Example 11 : Which is greater? 

(a) 1 or 0.99 (b) 1.09 or 1.093 
00 99 

..
.

Solution : (a) 11
.
; 099 
.
0 
.. 


10 100 10 100 

The whole part of 1 is greater than that of 0.99. 
Therefore, 1 > 0.99 

090 093 

(b) 109 . 
.
1
... 
. 
.
1; 1 093 
... 


10 100 1000 10 100 1000 

In this case, the two numbers have same parts upto hundredth. 
But the thousandths part of 1.093 is greater than that of 1.09. 
Therefore, 1.093 > 1.09. 


EXERCISE 8.3 

1. Which is greater? 
(a) 0.3 or 0.4 (b) 0.07 or 0.02 (c) 3 or 0.8 (d) 0.5 or 0.05 
(e) 1.23 or 1.2 (f) 0.099 or 0.19 (g) 1.5 or 1.50 (h) 1.431 or 1.490 
(i) 3.3 or 3.300 (j) 5.64 or 5.603 
2. Make five more examples and find the greater number from them. 
(i) Write 2 rupees 5 paise 
and 2 rupees 50 paise 
in decimals? 
(ii) Write 20 rupees 
7 paise and 21 rupees 
75 paise in decimals? 
8.5 Using Decimals 
8.5.1 Money 
We know that 100 paise = Re 1 

1 

Therefore, 1 paise = Re = Re 0.01 

10065 

So, 65 paise = Re = Re 0.65 

100 
5 

and 5 paise = Re = Re 0.05 

100

What is 105 paise? It is Re 1 and 5 paise = Rs 1.05

8.5.2 Length 
Mahesh wanted to measure the length of his 
table top in metres. He had a 50 cm scale. 
He found that the length of the table top was 
156 cm. What will be its length in metres? 

Mahesh knew that 

1 

1 cm = m or 0.01 m 

10056 

Therefore, 56 cm = m = 0.56 m 

100

Thus, the length of the table top is 
156 cm = 100 cm + 56 cm

56 

 = 1 m + m = 1.56 m. 

100

Mahesh also wants to represent 
this length pictorially. He took 
squared papers of equal size and 
divided them into 100 equal parts. 
He considered each small square as 
one cm. 

1. Can you write 4 mm in ‘cm’ using 
decimals? 
2. How will you write 7cm 5 mm in ‘cm’ 
using decimals? 
3. Can you now write 52 m as ‘km’ 
using decimals? How will you 
write 340 m as ‘km’ using decimals? 
How will you write 2008 m in ‘km’? 
100cm 56cm 


8.5.3 Weight 
Nandu bought 500g potatoes, 250g capsicum, 
700g onions, 500g tomatoes, 100g ginger and 
300g radish. What is the total weight of the 
vegetables in the bag? Let us add the weight of all 
the vegetables in the bag. 

500 g + 250 g + 700 g + 500 g + 100 g + 300 g 
= 2350 g

... 


1. Can you now write 
456g as ‘kg’ using 
decimals? 
2. How will you write 
2kg 9g in ‘kg’ using 
decimals? 

....... 


We know that 1000 g = 1 kg 

1 

Therefore, 1 g = kg = 0.001 kg

1000 


Thus, 2350 g = 2000 g + 350 g 

2000 350 
= kg 
.
kg 
1000 1000 

= 2 kg + 0.350 kg = 2.350 kg 

i.e. 2350 g = 2 kg 350 g = 2.350 kg 
Thus, the weight of vegetables in Nandu’s bag is 2.350 kg. 
EXERCISE 8.4 

1. Express as rupees using decimals. 
(a) 5 paise (b) 75 paise (c) 20 paise

8.6 Addition of Numbers with Decimals 
DoThis
Add 0.35 and 0.42. 
Take a square and divide it into 100 equal parts. 

...

.......... 



Mark 0.35 in this square by shading 
3 tenths and colouring 5 hundredths. 
Mark 0.42 in this square by shading 
4 tenths and colouring 2 hundredths. 
Now count the total number of tenths in the square and 

the total number of hundredths in the square. 


Ones Tenths Hundredths 
0 3 5 
+ 0 4 2 
0 7 7 
Therefore, 0.35 + 0.42 = 0.77 

Thus, we can add decimals in the same 
way as whole numbers. 

Can you now add 0.68 and 0.54? 

Find 
(i) 0.29 + 0.36 (ii) 0.7 + 0.08 
(iii) 1.54 + 1.80 (iv) 2.66 + 1.85 
Ones Tenths Hundredths 
0 6 8 
+ 0 5 4 
1 2 2 
Thus, 0.68 + 0.54 = 1.22 

Example 12 : Lata spent Rs 9.50 for buying a pen and Rs 2.50 for one pencil. 
How much money did she spend? 
Solution : Money spent for pen = Rs 9.50 

Money spent for pencil = Rs 2.50 
Total money spent = Rs 9.50 + Rs 2.50 
Total money spent = Rs 12.00 

Example 13 : Samson travelled 5 km 52 m by bus, 2 km 265 m by car and the 
rest 1km 30 m he walked. How much distance did he travel in all? 
Solution : Distance travelled by bus = 5 km 52 m = 5.052 km 
Distance travelled by car = 2 km 265 m = 2.265 km 

Distance travelled on foot = 1 km 30 m = 1.030 km 

... 




....... 


Therefore, total distance travelled is 

5.052 km 
2.265 km 
+ 1.030 km 
8.347 km 
Therefore, total distance travelled = 8.347 km 

Example 14 : Rahul bought 4 kg 90 g of apples, 2 kg 60 g of grapes and 
5 kg 300 g of mangoes. Find the total weight of all the fruits he bought. 
Solution : Weight of apples = 4 kg 90 g = 4.090 kg 

Weight of grapes = 2 kg 60 g = 2.060 kg 

Weight of mangoes = 5 kg 300 g = 5.300 kg 

Therefore, the total weight of the fruits bought is 

4.090 kg 
2.060 kg 
+ 5.300 kg 
11.450 kg 
Total weight of the fruits bought = 11.450 kg.

8.7 Subtraction of Decimals 
DoThis
Subtract 1.32 from 2.58 
This can be shown by the table. 

Ones Tenths Hundredths 
2 5 8 
– 1 3 2 
1 2 6 
Thus, 2.58 – 1.32 = 1.26 

Therefore, we can say that, subtraction of decimals can be done by 
subtracting hundredths from hundredths, tenths from tenths, ones from ones 
and so on, just as we did in addition. 

Sometimes while subtracting decimals, we may need to regroup like we did 
in addition. 

Let us subtract 1.74 from 3.5.

Example 15 : Abhishek had Rs 7.45. He bought toffees for Rs 5.30. Find the 
balance amount left with Abhishek. 
Solution : Total amount of money = Rs 7.45 

Amount spent on toffees = Rs 5.30 

Balance amount of money = Rs 7.45 – Rs 5.30 = Rs 2.15 
Example 16 : Urmila’s school is at a distance of 5 km 350 m from her house. 
She travels 1 km 70 m on foot and the rest by bus. How much distance does she

Solution : Total distance of school from the house = 5.350 km 
Distance travelled on foot = 1.070 km 
Therefore, distance travelled by bus = 5.350 km – 1.070 km 
= 4.280 km 

Thus, distance travelled by bus = 4.280 km or 4 km 280 m 
Example 17 : Kanchan bought a watermelon weighing 5 kg 200 g. Out of 
this she gave 2 kg 750 g to her neighbour. What is the weight of the watermelon 
left with Ruby? 

Solution : Total weight of the watermelon = 5.200 kg 
Watermelon given to the neighbour = 2.750 kg 
Therefore, weight of the remaining watermelon 
= 5.200 kg – 2.750 kg = 2.450 kg

What have we discussed? 

1. To understand the parts of one whole (i.e. a unit) we represent a unit by a block. One 
1 

block divided into 10 equal parts means each part is (one-tenth) of a unit. It can

10

be written as 0.1 in decimal notation. The dot represents the decimal point and it 
comes between the units place and the tenths place. 

2. Every fraction with denominator 10 can be written in decimal notation and vice-versa. 
1 

3. One block divided into 100 equal parts means each part is () (one-hundredth) of
100

a unit. It can be written as 0.01 in decimal notation. 

4. Every fraction with denominator 100 can be written in decimal notation and 
vice-versa. 
5. In the place value table, as we go from left to the right, the multiplying factor becomes 
1 

 of the previous factor.

6. All decimals can also be represented on a number line. 
7. Every decimal can be written as a fraction. 
8. Any two decimal numbers can be compared among themselves. The comparison can 
start with the whole part. If the whole parts are equal then the tenth parts can be 
compared and so on. 
9. Decimals are used in many ways in our lives. For example, in representing units of 
money, length and weight.

9.1 Introduction 
Capthr9Chapter 9 
DtaHanligDaandinDataHandlingDataHandlingData Handling 
You must have observed your teacher recording the attendance of students in 
your class everyday, or recording marks obtained by you after every test or 
examination. Similarly, you must have also seen a cricket score board. Two 
score boards have been illustrated here : 

Name of the bowlers Overs Maiden overs Runs given Wickets taken 
A 10 2 40 3 
B 10 1 30 2 
C 10 2 20 1 
D 10 1 50 4 

Name of the batsmen Runs Balls faced Time (in min.) 
E 45 62 75 
F 55 70 81 
G 37 53 67 
H 22 41 55 

You know that in a game of cricket the information recorded is not simply 
about who won and who lost. In the score board, you will also find some 
equally important information about the game. For instance, you may find 
out the time taken and number of balls faced by the highest run-scorer. 


........... 


Similarly, in your day to day life, you must have seen several kinds of tables 
consisting of numbers, figures, names etc. 

These tables provide ‘Data’. A data is a collection of numbers gathered to 
give some information. 

9.2 Recording Data 
Let us take an example of a class which is preparing to go for a picnic. The 
teacher asked the students to give their choice of fruits out of banana, apple, 
orange or guava. Uma is asked to prepare the list. She prepared a list of all the 
children and wrote the choice of fruit against each name. This list would help 
the teacher to distribute fruits according to the choice. 

Raghav — Banana Bhawana — Apple 
Preeti — Apple Manoj — Banana 
Amar — Guava Donald — Apple 
Fatima — Orange Maria — Banana 
Amita — Apple Uma — Orange 
Raman — Banana Akhtar — Guava 
Radha — Orange Ritu — Apple 
Farida — Guava Salma — Banana 
Anuradha — Banana Kavita — Guava 
Rati — Banana Javed — Banana 

If the teacher wants to know the number of bananas required 
for the class, she has to read the names in the list one by one 
and count the total number of bananas required. To know the 
number of apples, guavas and oranges seperately she has to 
repeat the same process for each of these fruits. How tedious 
and time consuming it is! It might become more tedious if the 
list has, say, 50 students. 

So, Uma writes only the names of these fruits one by one 
like, banana, apple, guava, orange, apple, banana, orange, guava, 
banana, banana, apple, banana, apple, banana, orange, guava, 
apple, banana, guava, banana. 

Do you think this makes the teacher’s work easier? She 
still has to count the fruits in the list one by one as she did 
earlier. 

Salma has another idea. She makes four squares on the floor. 
Every square is kept for fruit of one kind only. She asks the 
students to put one pebble in the square which matches their 


Banana 


Orange 


Apple 

...

.......... 


choices. i.e. a student opting for banana will put a pebble in the 
square marked for banana and so on. 

By counting the pebbles in each square, Salma can quickly tell 
the number of each kind of fruit required. She can get the required 


Guava

information quickly by systematically placing the pebbles in 
different squares. 

Try to perform this activity for 40 students and with names of any four fruits. 
Instead of pebbles you can also use bottle caps or some other token. 

9.3 Organisation of Data 
To get the same information which Salma got, Ronald needs only a pen and a 
paper. He does not need pebbles. He also does not ask students to come and 
place the pebbles. He prepares the following table. 

Banana 
........
8 
Orange 
... 
3 
Apple 
..... 
5 
Guava 
.... 
4 

Do you understand Ronald’s table? 

What does one (
.
) mark indicate? 

Four students preferred guava. How many (
.
) marks are there against guava? 

How many students were there in the class? Find all this information. 

Discuss about these methods. Which is the best? Why? Which method is 
more useful when information from a much larger data is required? 

Example 1 : A teacher wants to know the choice of food of each student as 
part of the mid-day meal programme. The teacher assigns the task of 
collecting this information to Maria. Maria does so using a paper and a 
pencil. After arranging the choices in a column, she puts against a choice of 
food one ( | ) mark for every student making that choice. 

Choice Number of students 
Rice only | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 
Chapati only | | | | | | | | | | | | | 
Both rice and chapati | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

... 



........... 


Umesh, after seeing the table suggested a better method to count the students. 
He asked Maria to organise the marks ( | ) in a group of ten as shown below : 

Choice Tally marks Number of students 
Rice only 
Chapati only 
Both rice and chapati 
| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 
| | | | | | | | | | | | | 
| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 
17 
13 
20 

Rajan made it simpler by asking her to make groups of five instead of ten, as 
shown below : 

Choice Tally marks Number of 
students 
Rice only | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 17 
Chapati only | | | | | | | | | | | | | 13 
Both rice and chapati | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 20 

Teacher suggested that the fifth mark in a group of five marks should be 
used as a cross, as shown by ‘ 


’. These are tally marks. Thus, 
shows the count to be five plus two (i.e. seven) and 


shows five 
plus five (i.e. ten). 
With this, the table looks like : 

Choice Tally marks Number of students 
Rice only 
17 
Chapati only 
13 
Both rice and chapati 
20 

Example 2 : Ekta is asked to collect data for size of shoes of students in her 
Class VI. Her finding are recorded in the manner shown below : 

5 4 7 5 6 7 6 5 6 6 5 
4 5 6 8 7 4 6 5 6 4 6 
5 7 6 7 5 7 6 4 8 7 

...

.......... 


Javed wanted to know (i) the size of shoes worn by the maximum number of 

students. (ii) the size of shoes worn by the minimum number of students. Can 

you find this information? 

Ekta prepared a table using tally marks. 


Shoe size Tally marks Number of students

Now the questions asked earlier could be answered easily. 
You may also do some such activity in your class using tally marks. 

DoThis
1. Collect information regarding the number of family members of your 
classmates and represent it in the form of a table. Find to which category 
most students belong. 
Number of family Tally marks members Number of students 
members with that many 
family members 

Make a table and enter the data using tally marks. Find the number that appeared 

(a) the minimum number of times? (b) the maximum number of times? 
(c) same number of times? 
9.4 Pictograph 
A cupboard has five 

Rows Number of books 

compartments. In 
each compartment a 
row of books is 
arranged. 

The details are 
indicated in the 

... 


adjoining table : 


........... 


Which row has the greatest number of books? Which row has the least number 
of books? Is there any row which does not have books? 
You can answer these questions by just studying the diagram. The picture 
visually helps you to understand the data. It is a pictograph. 
A pictograph represents data through pictures of objects. It helps 
answer the questions on the data at a glance. 

DoThis
Pictographs are often used by dailies and 
magazines to attract readers attention. 

Collect one or two such published pictographs 

and display them in your class. Try to understand 

what they say. 

It requires some practice to understand the 
information given by a pictograph. 

9.5 Interpretation of a Pictograph 
Example 3 : The following pictograph shows the number of absentees in a 
class of 30 students during the previous week : 

Days Number of absentees 
(a) On which day were the maximum number of students absent? 
(b) Which day had full attendance? 
(c) What was the total number of absentees in that week? 

Solution : (a) Maximum absentees were on saturday. (There are 8 pictures in 
the row for saturday; on all other days, the number of pictures are less). 

(b) Against thursday, there is no picture, i.e. no one is absent. Thus, on that day 
the class had full attendance. 
(c) There are 20 pictures in all. So, the total number of absentees in that 
week was 20. 
...

.......... 


Example 4 : The colours of fridges preferred by people living in a locality are 
shown by the following pictograph : 

Colours Number of people 


(a) Find the number of people preferring blue colour. 
(b) How many people liked red colour? 
Solution : (a) Blue colour is preferred by 40 people. 
[ 


= 10, so 4 pictures indicate 4 × 10 people]. 

(b) Deciding the number of people liking red colour needs more care. 
For 5 complete pictures, we get 5 × 10 = 50 people. 
For the last incomplete picture, we may roughly take it as 5. 
So, number of people preferring red colour is nearly 55. 
Think, discuss and write 

In the above example, the number of people who like Red colour was taken as 

50 + 5. If your friend wishes to take it as 50 + 8, is it acceptable? 
Example 5 : A survey was carried out on 30 students of class VI in a school. 
Data about the different modes of transport used by them to travel to school 
was displayed as pictograph. 

What can you conclude from the pictograph? 

Modes of travelling Number of students 


... 



........... 


Solution : From the pictograph we find that: 

(a) The number of students coming by private car is 4. 
(b) Maximum number of students use the school bus. This is the most 
popular way. 
(c) Cycle is used by only three students. 
(d) The number of students using the other modes can be similarly found. 

Example 6 : Following is the pictograph of the number of wrist watches 
manufactured by a factory in a particular week. 

Days Number of wrist watches 
manufactured 
(a) On which day were the least number of wrist watches manufactured? 
(b) On which day were the maximum number of wrist watches 
manufactured? 
(c) Find out the approximate number of wrist watches manufactured in the 
particular week? 

We can complete the following table and find the answers. 

Days Number of wrist watches manufactured 
Monday 
Tuesday 
Wednesday 
Thursday 
Friday 
Saturday 
600 
More than 700 and less than 800

(b) How many fruit baskets were sold by Anwar? 
(c) The merchants who have sold 600 or more number of baskets are planning to buy 
a godown for the next season. Can you name them? 
9.6 Drawing a Pictograph 
Drawing a pictograph is interesting. But sometimes, a symbol like 


(which 

was used in one of the previous examples) may represent multiple units and 
may be difficult to draw. Instead of it we can use simpler symbols. If 


represents 
say 5 students, how will you represent, say, 4 or 3 students? 
We can solve such a situation by making an assumption that — 
represents 5 students, 


represents 4 students, 
represents 3 students, 


represents 2 students, 


represents 1 student, and 
then start the task of representation. 

Example 7 : The following are the details of number of students present in a 
class of 30 during a week. Represent it by a pictograph. 

Days Number of students present 
Monday 
Tuesday 
Wednesday 
24 
26 
28 

... 



........... 


Thursday 30 
Friday 29 
Saturday 22 

Solution : With the assumptions we have made earlier, 
24 may be represented by 
26 may be represented by 


and so on. 
Thus, the pictograph would be 

Days Number of students present 
Monday 
Tuesday 
Wednesday 
Thursday 
Friday 
Saturday 


We had some sort of agreement over how to represent ‘less than 5’ by a 
picture. Such a sort of splitting the pictures may not be always possible. In 
such cases what shall we do? 

Study the following example. 
Example 8 : The following are the number of electric bulbs purchased for a 
lodging house during the first four months of a year. 

Months Number of bulbs 
January 20 
February 26 
March 30 
April 34 

Represent the details by a pictograph. 

...

.......... 


Solution : Picturising for January and March is Let 


represent 10 bulbs. 


not difficult. But representing 26 and 34 with the 
pictures is not easy. 

We may round off 26 to nearest 5 i.e. to 25 
and 34 to 35. We then show two and a half bulbs 
for February and three and a half for April.

9.7 A Bar Graph 
Representing data by pictograph is not only time consuming but at times difficult 
too. Let us see some other way of representing data visually. Bars of uniform 
width can be drawn horizontally or vertically with equal spacing between them 
and then the length of each bar represents the given number. Such method of 

... 


representing data is called a bar diagram or a bar graph. 


........... 


9.7.1 Interpretation of a bar graph 
Let us look at the example of vehicular traffic at a busy road crossing in Delhi, 
which was studied by the traffic police on a particular day. The number of vehicles 
passing through the crossing every hour from 6 a.m. to 12.00 noon is shown in 
the bar graph. One unit of length stands for 100 vehicles. 

Time intervals 
The scale is 1 unit length equal to 100 
vehicles. 
i.e. 1 unit length = 100 vehicles 
Number of vehicles 

We can see that maximum traffic is shown by the longest bar (i.e. 1200 
vehicles) for the time interval 7-8 a.m. The second longer bar is for 8-9 a.m. 
Similarly, minimum traffic is shown by the smallest bar (i.e. 100 vehicles) for 
the time interval 6-7 a.m. The bar just longer than the smallest bar is between 

11 a.m. - 12 noon. 

The total traffic during 
the two peak hours 
(8.00-10.00 am) as shown 
by the two long bars is 
1000+900 = 1900 vehicles. 

If the numbers in the 
data are large, then you may 
need a different scale. 
For example, take the case 
of the growth of the 
population of India. The 
numbers are in crores. So, 

...
1 unit length = 10 crores 
Years 
Population of India 
if you take 1 unit length to 


.......... 


be one person, drawing the bars will not be possible. Therefore, choose the 
scale as 1 unit to represents 10 crores. The bar graph for this case is shown in 
the figure. 

So, the bar of length 5 units represents 50 crores and of 8 units represents 
80 crores. 


Example 9 : Read the 
adjoining bar graph 
showing the number of 
students in a particular 
class of a school. 

Answer the 
following questions : 

(a) What is the 
scale of this 
graph? 
(b) How many new 
students are added 
every year? 
Number of students 
1 unit length = 10 students 
Years 

(c) Is the number of students in the year 2003 twice that in the year 2000? 
Solution : (a) The scale is 1 unit length equals 10 students. 
Try (b) and (c) for yourself. 


EXERCISE 9.3

(d) State the name of the subjects and marks obtained in each of them. 
9.7.2 Drawing a bar graph 
Recall the example where Ronald (section 9.3) had prepared a table representing 
choice of fruits made by his classmates. Let us draw a bar graph for this data. 


Name of fruits Banana Orange Apple Guava 
Number of students 8 3 5 4 

First of all draw a horizontal 
line and a vertical line. On the 
horizontal line we will draw bars 
representing each fruit and on 
vertical line we will write 
numerals representing number of 
students. 

1 unit length = 1 student 
Let us choose a scale. It means 
we first decide how many 
students will be represented by 
unit length of a bar. 


Here, we take 1 unit length to 
represent 1 student only. 

We get a bar graph as shown in 
adjoining figure. 

Example 10 : Following table shows the monthly expenditure of Imran’s family 
on various items. 

Items Expenditure (in Rs) 
House rent 
Food 
Education 
Electricity 
Transport 
Miscellaneous 
3000 
3400 
800 
400 
600 
1200 

To represent this data in the form of a bar diagram, here are the steps. 

(a) Draw two perpendicular lines, one vertical and one horizontal. 
(b) Along the horizontal line, mark the ‘items’ and along the vertical line, mark 
the corresponding expenditure.
... 



........... 


(c) Take bars of same width keeping uniform gap between them. 
(d) Choose suitable scale along the vertical line. Let 1 unit length = Rs 200 and 
then mark the corresponding values. 
Calculate the heights of the bars for various items as shown below. 
House rent : 3000 ÷ 200 = 15 units 
Food : 3400 ÷ 200 = 17 units 
Education : 800 ÷ 200 = 4 units 
Electricity : 400 ÷ 200 = 2 units 
Transport : 600 ÷ 200 = 3 units 
Miscellaneous : 1200 ÷ 200 = 6 units 

1 unit length = 200 rupees 
Items 

...

.......... 


Same data can be represented by interchanging positions of items and

What have we discussed? 

1. We have seen that data is a collection of numbers gathered to give some information. 
2. To get a particular information from the given data quickly, the data can be arranged 
in a tabular form using tally marks. 
3. We learnt how a pictograph represents data in the form of pictures, objects or parts 
of objects. We have also seen how to interpret a pictograph and answer the related 
questions. We have drawn pictographs using symbols to represent a certain number 
of items or things. For example, = 100 books. 


4. We have discussed how to represent data by using a bar diagram or a bar graph. In 
a bar graph, bars of uniform width are drawn horizontally or vertically with equal 
spacing between them. The length of each bar gives the required information. 
5. To do this we also discussed the process of choosing a scale for the graph. 
For example, 1 unit = 100 students. We have also practised reading a given bar 
graph. We have seen how interpretations from the same can be made.

When we talk about some plane figures as shown below we think of their 
regions and their boundaries. We need some measures to compare them. We 
look into these now. 
10.2 Perimeter 
Look at the following figures (Fig. 10.1). You can make them with a wire or a string. 
If you start from the point S in each case and move along the line segments 
then you again reach the point S. You have made a complete round of the

shape in each case (a), (b) & (c). The distance covered is equal to the length of 
wire used to draw the figure. 

This distance is known as the perimeter of the closed figure. It is the 
length of the wire needed to form the figures. 

The idea of perimeter is widely used in our daily life. 
.
A farmer who wants to fence his field. 


.
An engineer who plans to build a compound wall on all sides of a house. 
.
A person preparing a track to conduct sports. 

All these people use the idea of ‘perimeter’. 

Give five examples of situations where you need to know the perimeter. 

Perimeter is the distance covered along the boundary forming a closed 
figure when you go round the figure once. 

1. Measure and write the length of the four sides of the top of your 
study table. 
AB = ____ cm 
BC = ____ cm 
CD = ____ cm 
DA = ____ cm 
Now, the sum of the lengths of the four sides 
= AB + BC + CD + DA 
= ___ cm +___ cm +___ cm +___ cm 
= _____ cm 
What is the perimeter? 
2. Measure and write the lengths of the four sides of a page of your 
notebook. The sum of the lengths of the four sides 
= AB + BC + CD + DA 
= ___ cm +___ cm +___ cm +___ cm 
= _____ cm 
What is the perimeter of the page? 
3. Meera went to a park 150 m long and 80 m wide. She took one 
complete round on its boundary. What is the distance covered by 
her?

Perimeter = AB + BC + CD + DA

So, how will you find the perimeter of any closed figure made up entirely 
of line segments? Simply find the sum of the lengths of all the sides (which 
are line segments).

MATHEMATICS 


10.2.1 Perimeter of a rectangle 
Let us consider a rectangle ABCD (Fig 10.2) 
whose length and breadth are 15 cm and 9 cm 
respectively. What will be its perimeter? 

Perimeter of the rectangle = Sum of the 
lengths of its four sides. 

Fig 10.2 


Remember that 
opposite sides of a 
rectangle are equal 
so AB = CD, 
AD = BC 
=AB + BC + CD + DA 
=AB + BC + AB + BC 
= 2 × AB + 2 × BC 
= 2 × (AB + BC) 
= 2 × (15cm + 9cm) 
= 2 × (24cm) 
= 48 cm 

Find the perimeter of the following rectangles: 

Length of 
rectangle 
Breadth of 
rectanglePerimeter by adding 
all the sidesPerimeter by 
2 × (Length + Breadth) 
25 cm 12 cm = 25 cm + 12 cm 
+ 25 cm + 12 cm 
= 74 cm 
= 2 ×(25 cm + 12 cm) 
= 2 × (37 cm) 
= 74 cm 
0.5 m 0.25 m 
18 cm 15 cm 
10.5 cm 8.5 cm 

Hence, from the said example, we notice that 
Perimeter of a rectangle = length + breadth + length + breadth 

i.e. Perimeter of a rectangle = 2 × (length + breadth) 
Let us now see practical applications of this idea : 
Example 1 : Shabana wants to put a lace border all around a rectangular table 
cover (Fig 10.3), 3 m long and 2 m wide. Find the length of the lace required 
by Shabana. 

Solution : Length of the rectangular table cover = 3 m 
Breadth of the rectangular table cover = 2 m 

Shabana wants to put a lace border all around the 
table cover. Therefore, the length of the lace required 
will be equal to the perimeter of the rectangular table 

208 


cover. 

Fig 10.3 



MENSURATION 


Now, perimeter of the rectangular table cover 
= 2 × (length + breadth) = 2 × (3 m + 2 m) = 2 × 5m = 10m 
So, length of the lace required is 10 m. 

Example 2 : An athlete takes 10 rounds of a rectangular park, 50 m long and 
25 m wide. Find the total distance covered by him. 

Solution : Length of the rectangular park = 50 m 
Breadth of the rectangular park = 25 m 
Total distance covered by the athlete in one round will be the perimeter of 

the park. 
Now, perimeter of the rectangular park 
= 2 × (length + breadth)= 2 × (50 m + 25 m) 
= 2 × 75 m = 150 m 
So, the distance covered by the athlete in one round is 150 m. 
Therefore, distance covered in 10 rounds = 10 × 150 m = 1500m 
The total distance covered by the athlete is 1500 m. 

Example 3 : Find the perimeter of a rectangle whose length and breadth are 
150 cm and 1 m respectively. 

150 cm 

Solution : Length = 150 cm 

Breadth = 1m = 100 cm 
Perimeter of the rectangle 
= 2 × (length + breadth) 
= 2 × (150 cm + 100 cm) 

150 cm 

= 2 × (250 cm) = 500 cm = 5 m 

Example 4 : A farmer has a rectangular field 
of length and breadth 240 m and 180 m 
respectively. He wants to fence it with 3 
rounds of rope as shown in figure 10.4. 
What is the total length of rope he must use? 

Solution : The farmer has to cover three 
times the perimeter of that field. Therefore, 
total length of rope required is thrice its perimeter. 

Perimeter of the field = 2 × (length + breadth) 
= 2 × ( 240 m + 180 m) 
= 2 × 420 m = 840 m 

Total length of rope required = 3 × 840 m = 2520 m

Now, we know that all the four sides of a square are equal, therefore, in 
place of adding it four times, we can multiply the length of one side by 4. 

Perimeter of an equilateral triangle = 3 × length of a side 

What is similar between a square and an equilateral triangle? They are figures 
having all the sides of equal length and all the angles of equal measure. Such 

breadth 175 m at the rate of Rs 12 per metre. 
Solution : Length of the rectangular park = 250 m 
Breadth of the rectangular park = 175 m 
To calculate the cost of fencing we require perimeter. 
Perimeter of the rectangle = 2 × (length + breadth) 
= 2 × (250 m + 175 m) 
= 2 × (425 m) = 850 m 
Cost of fencing 1m of park = Rs 12 
Therefore, the total cost of fencing the park 
= Rs 12 × 850 = Rs 10200 

10.2.2 Perimeter of regular shapes 
Consider this example. 


1 
. 


Biswamitra wants to put coloured tape all around a 
square picture (Fig 10.5) of side 1m as shown. What will be 
the length of the coloured tape he requires? 

Since Biswamitra wants to put the coloured tape all 
around the square picture, he needs to find the perimeter 

1 
.

of the picture frame. 

Fig 10.5

Thus, the length of the tape required 
= Perimeter of square = 1m + 1 m + 1 m + 1 m = 4 m 

Thus, the length of the tape required = 4 × 1 m = 4 m 
From this example, we see that 

Perimeter of a square = 4 × length of a side 

Draw more such squares and find the perimeters. 

Now, look at equilateral triangle (Fig 10.6) with each side 
equal to 4 cm. Can we find its perimeter? 
Perimeter of this equilateral triangle = 4 + 4 + 4 cm 

= 3 × 4 cm = 12 cm 
So, we find that

Find various 
objects from your 
surroundings which 
have regular shapes 
and find their 
perimeters. 
figures are known as regular closed figures. Thus, a 
square and an equilateral triangle are regular closed 
figures. 

You found that, 
Perimeter of a square = 4 × length of one side 
Perimeter of an equilateral triangle = 3 × length 

of one side 
So, what will be the perimeter of a regular 

pentagon? 
A regular pentagon has five equal sides. 
Therefore, perimeter of a regular pentagon = 5 × length of one side and 

the perimeter of a regular hexagon will be _______ and of an octagon will 
be ______. 

Example 6 : Find the distance travelled by Shaina if she takes three rounds of 
a square park of side 70 m. 

Solution : Perimeter of the square park = 4 × length of a side = 4 × 70 m = 280 m 
Distance covered in one round = 280 m 
Therefore, distance travelled in three rounds =3×280m = 840m 

Example 7 : Pinky runs around a square field of side 75 m, Bob 
runs around a rectangular field with length 160 m and breadth 
105 m. Who covers more distance and by how much? 

Solution : Distance covered by Pinky in one round = Perimeter of the square 
= 4 × length of a side 
= 4 × 75 m = 300 m 

Distance covered by Bob in one round = Perimeter of the rectangle 
= 2 × (length + breadth) 
= 2 × (160 m + 105 m) 
= 2 × 265 m = 530 m 

Difference in the distance covered = 530 m – 300 m = 230 m. 
Therefore, Bob covers more distance by 230 m. 

Example 8 : Find the perimeter of a regular pentagon with each side 
measuring 3 cm. 

Solution : This regular closed figure has 5 sides, each with a length of 3 cm. 
Thus, we get 
Perimeter of the regular pentagon = 5 × 3 cm = 15 cm 

Example 9 : The perimeter of a regular hexagon is 18 cm. How long is its one 
side? 


211

MATHEMATICS 


Solution : Perimeter = 18 cm 

A regular hexagon has 6 sides, so we can divide 

the perimeter by 6 to get the length of one side. 
One side of the hexagon = 18 cm ÷ 6 = 3 cm 
Therefore, length of each side of the regular 

hexagon is 3 cm.

Make an outline of the figure. 
Look at the squares enclosed by the figure. Some of them are completely 

enclosed, some half, some less than half and some more than half. 
The area is the number of centimetre squares that are needed to cover it.

MENSURATION 


But there is a small problem : the squares do not always fit exactly into the 
area you measure. We get over this difficulty by adopting a convention : 

.
The area of one full square is taken as 1 sq unit. If it is a centimetre 

square sheet, then area of one full square will be 1 sq cm. 

.
Ignore portions of the area that are less than half a square. 

.
If more than half of a square is in a region, just count it as one square. 

. 


.
If exactly half the square is counted, take its area as sq unit.

.

Such a convention gives a fair estimate of the desired area. 
Example 10 : Find the area of the shape shown in the figure 10.10. 

Solution : This figure is made up of line-segments. 
Moreover, it is covered by full squares and half

10.3.1 Area of a rectangle 
With the help of the squared paper, can we tell, what will be the area of a 
rectangle whose length is 5 cm and breadth is 3 cm?

Yes, it is possible.

We find that in each case, 

Area of the square = side × side 

You may use this as a formula in doing problems. 

Example 13 : Find the area of a rectangle whose length and breadth are 
12 cm and 4 cm respectively. 
Solution : Length of the rectangle = 12 cm 

Breadth of the rectangle = 4 cm 
Area of the rectangle = length × breadth 
= 12 cm × 4 cm = 48 sq cm. 
Example 14 : Find the area of a square plot of side 8 m. 

Solution : Side of the square = 8 m 
Area of the square = side × side 
= 8 m × 8 m = 64 sq m. 

Example 15 : The area of a rectangular piece of cardboard is 36 sq cm and its 
length is 9 cm. What is the width of the cardboard? 

Solution : Area of the rectangle = 36 sq cm 

Length = 9 cm 

Width = ? 

Area of a rectangle = length × width 

... 
.. 


So, width = = = 4 cm

.......

Thus, the width of the rectangular cardboard is 4 cm. 

Example 16 : Bob wants to cover the floor of a room 3 m wide and 4 m long 
by squared tiles. If each square tile is of side 0.5 m, then find the number of 
tiles required to cover the floor of the room. 

Solution : Total area of tiles must be equal to the area of the floor of the room. 
Length of the room = 4 m 


Breadth of the room = 3 m 
Area of the floor = length × breadth 
= 4 m × 3 m = 12 sq m 
Area of one square tile = side × side

11.1 Introduction 
Che1aptChapter 11 
AlgebraAlbrAlgebraAlgebraAlgebra 
Our study so far has been with numbers and shapes. We have learnt numbers, 
operations on numbers and properties of numbers. We applied our knowledge 
of numbers to various problems in our life. The branch of mathematics in 
which we studied numbers is arithmetic. We have also learnt about figures in 
two and three dimensions and their properties. The branch of mathematics in 
which we studied shapes is geometry. Now we begin the study of another 
branch of mathematics. It is called algebra. 

The main feature of the new branch which we are going to study is the use 
of letters. Use of letters will allow us to write rules and formulas in a general 
way. By using letters, we can talk about any number and not just a particular 
number. Secondly, letters may stand for unknown quantities. By learning 
methods of determining unknowns, we develop powerful tools for solving 
puzzles and many problems from daily life. Thirdly, since letters stand for 
numbers, operations can be performed on them as on numbers. This leads to 
the study of algebraic expressions and their properties. 

You will find algebra interesting and useful. It is very useful in solving 
problems. Let us begin our study with simple examples. 

11.2 Matchstick Patterns 
Ameena and Sarita are making patterns with matchsticks. They decide to make 
simple patterns of the letters of the English alphabet. Ameena takes two 
matchsticks and forms the letter L as shown in Fig 11.1 (a). 


.......... 


.......... 
Fig 11.1 
Then Sarita also picks two sticks, forms another letter L and puts it next to 
the one made by Ameena [Fig 11.1 (b)]. 

Then Ameena adds one more L and this goes on as shown by the dots in 
Fig 11.1 (c). 

Their friend Appu comes in. He looks at the pattern. Appu always asks 
questions. He asks the girls, “How many matchsticks will be required to make 
seven Ls”? Ameena and Sarita are systematic. They go on forming the patterns 
with 1L, 2Ls, 3Ls, and so on and prepare a table. 

Table 1 

Number of 
Ls formed 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 .... .... 
Number of 
matchsticks 
required 
2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 .... .... 

Appu gets the answer to his question from the Table 1; 7Ls require 14 
matchsticks. 
While writing the table, Ameena realises that the number 
of matchsticks required is twice the number of Ls formed. 
Number of matchsticks required = 2 × number of Ls. 


For convenience, let us write the letter n for the number of 
Ls. If one L is made, n = 1; if two Ls are 
made, n = 2 and so on; thus, n can be any 
natural number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, .... We then write, 
Number of matchsticks required = 2 × n. 


Instead of writing 2 × n, we write 2n. Note 
that 2n is same as 2 × n. 

Ameena tells her friends that her rule 

gives the number of matchsticks required for 

forming any number of Ls. 

Thus, For n = 1, the number of matchsticks required = 2 × 1 = 2 
For n = 2, the number of matchsticks required = 2 × 2 = 4 
For n = 3, the number of matchsticks required = 2 × 3 = 6 etc. 

These numbers agree with those from Table 1. 

... 



...... 


Sarita says, “The rule is very powerful! Using the rule, I can say how 
many matchsticks are required to form even 100 Ls. I do not need to draw the 
pattern or make a table, once the rule is known”. 
Do you agree with Sarita? 

11.3 The Idea of a Variable 
In the above example, we found a rule to give the number of matchsticks 
required to make a pattern of Ls. The rule was : 

Number of matchsticks required = 2n 

Here, n is the number of Ls in the pattern, and n takes values 1, 2, 3, 4,.... Let 
us look at Table 1 once again. In the table, the value of n goes on changing 
(increasing). As a result, the number of matchsticks required also goes on 
changing (increasing). 

n is an example of a variable. Its value is not fixed; it can take any value 
1, 2, 3, 4, ... . We wrote the rule for the number of matchsticks required 
using the variable n. 

The word ‘variable’ means something that can vary, i.e. change. The value 
of a variable is not fixed. It can take different values. 

We shall look at another example of matchstick patterns to learn more 
about variables. 

11.4 More Matchstick Patterns 
Ameena and Sarita have become quite interested in matchstick patterns. They 
now want to try a pattern of the letter C. To make one C, they use three 
matchsticks as shown in Fig. 11.2(a). 


Fig 11.2 

Table 2 gives the number of matchsticks required to make a pattern of Cs. 

Table 2 

Number 
of Cs formed 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 .... .... .... 
Number 
of matchsticks 
required 
3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 .... .... .... 

...

.......... 



Can you complete the entries left blank in the table? 
Sarita comes up with the rule : 

Number of matchsticks required = 3n 

She has used the letter n for the number of Cs; n is a variable taking on values 

1, 2, 3, 4, ... 

Do you agree with Sarita ? 

Remember 3n is the same as 3 × n. 

Next, Ameena and Sarita wish to make a pattern of Fs. They make one F 
using 4 matchsticks as shown in Fig 11.3(a). 

Fig 11.3 


Can you now write the rule for making patterns of F? 
Think of other letters of the alphabet and other shapes that can be made 
from matchsticks. For example, U ( 

), V ( 


), triangle ( 
), square ( 
) etc. 
Choose any five and write the rules for making matchstick patterns with them. 

11.5 More Examples of Variables 
We have used the letter n to show a variable. Raju asks, “Why not m”? 
There is nothing special about n, any letter can be used. 

One may use any letter as m, l, p, x, y, z etc. to show 
a variable. Remember, a variable is a number which 
does not have a fixed value. For example, the number 
5 or the number 100 or any other given number is 
not a variable. They have fixed values. Similarly, the 

number of angles of a triangle has a fixed value i.e. 3. 
It is not a variable. The number of corners of a 
quadrilateral (4) is fixed; it is also not a variable. 
But n in the examples we have looked is a variable. 
It takes on various values 1, 2, 3, 4, ... . 

... 




...... 


Let us now consider variables in a more 
familiar situation. 

Students went to buy notebooks from the 
school bookstore. Price of one notebook is 
Rs 5. Munnu wants to buy 5 notebooks, Appu 
wants to buy 7 notebooks, Sara wants to buy 4 
notebooks and so on. How much money should 
a student carry when she or he goes to the 
bookstore to buy notebooks? 

This will depend on how many notebooks the student wants to buy. The 
students work together to prepare a table. 

Table 3 


Number of 
notebooks 
required 
1 2 3 4 5 ..... m ..... 
Total cost 
in rupees 
5 10 15 20 25 ..... 5m ..... 

The letter m stands for the number of notebooks a student wants to buy; m 
is a variable, which can take any value 1, 2, 3, 4, ... . The total cost of m 
notebooks is given by the rule : 

The total cost in rupees = 5 × number of note books required 

= 5m 

If Munnu wants to buy 5 
notebooks, then taking m = 5, we say 
that Munnu should carry 
Rs 5 × 5 or Rs 25 with him to the 
school bookstore. 

Let us take one more example. For 
the Republic Day celebration in the 
school, children are going to perform 
mass drill in the presence of the chief 
guest. They stand 10 in a row (Fig 
11.4). How many children can there 
be in the drill? 

The number of children will 

Fig 11.4 

depend on the number of rows. If 
there is 1 row, there will be 10 children. If there are 2 rows, there will be 
2 × 10 or 20 children and so on. If there are r rows, there will be 10r children 


...

.......... 


in the drill; here, r is a variable which stands for the number of rows and so 
takes on values 1, 2, 3, 4, ... . 

In all the examples seen so far, the variable was multiplied by a number. 

There can be different situations as well in which numbers are added to or 

subtracted from the variable as seen below. 

Sarita says that she has 10 more marbles in her collection than Ameena. If 
Ameena has 20 marbles, then Sarita has 30. If Ameena has 30 marbles, then 
Sarita has 40 and so on. We do not know exactly how many marbles Ameena 
has. She may have any number of marbles. 

But we know that, Sarita's marbles = Ameena's marbles + 10. 

We shall denote Ameena’s marbles by the letter x. Here, x is a variable, 
which can take any value 1, 2, 3, 4,... ,10,... ,20,... ,30,... . Using x, we write 
Sarita's marbles = x + 10. The expression (x + 10) is read as ‘x plus ten’. It 
means 10 added to x. If x is 20, (x + 10) is 30. If x is 30, (x + 10) is 40 and so on. 


The expression (x + 10) cannot be simplified further. 
Do not confuse x + 10 with 10x, they are different. 
In 10x, x is multiplied by 10. In (x + 10), 10 is added to x. 
We may check this for some values of x. 
For example, 
If x = 2, 10x = 10 × 2 = 20 and x + 10 = 2 + 10 = 12. 
If x = 10, 10x = 10 × 10 = 100 and x + 10 = 10 + 10 = 20. 


Raju and Balu are brothers. Balu is younger than Raju 
by 3 years. When Raju is 12 years old, Balu is 9 years old. 
When Raju is 15 years old, Balu is 12 years old. We do not 
know Raju’s age exactly. It may have any value. Let x denote 
Raju’s age in years, x is a variable. If Raju’s age in years is x, 
then Balu’s age in years is (x – 3). The expression (x – 3) is 
read as x minus three. As you would expect, when x is 12, 
(x – 3) is 9 and when x is 15, (x – 3) is 12.

in terms of the number of squares. (Hint : If you remove the vertical stick at 
the end, you will get a pattern of Cs.) 

(b) Fig 11.7 gives a matchstick pattern of triangles. As in Exercise 11 (a) above, 
find the general rule that gives the number of matchsticks in terms of the 
number of triangles. 
Fig 11.7 

11.6 Use of Variables in Common Rules 
Let us now see how certain common rules in mathematics that we have already 
learnt are expressed using variables. 

Rules from geometry 

We have already learnt about the perimeter of a square and of a rectangle in 
the chapter on Mensuration. Here, we go back to them to write them in the 
form of a rule. 

1. Perimeter of a square We know that perimeter of 
any polygon (a closed figure made up of 3 or more 
line segments) is the sum of the lengths of its sides. 
A square has 4 sides and they are equal in length 
(Fig 11.8). Therefore, 
The perimeter of a square = Sum of the lengths of the 
sides of the squareFig 11.8 
= 4 times the length of a side of the square 
= 4 × l = 4l. 

Thus, we get the rule for the perimeter of a square. The use of the variable 
l allows us to write the general rule in a way that is concise and easy to 
remember. 

We may take the perimeter also to be represented by a variable, say p. 
Then the rule for the perimeter of a square is expressed as a relation between 
the perimeter and the length of the square, p = 4l 

2. Perimeter of a rectangle We know that a rectangle 
has four sides. For example, the rectangle ABCD 
has four sides AB, BC, CD and DA. The opposite 
sides of any rectangle are always equal in length. 
Thus, in the rectangle ABCD, let us denote by l, the
... 



length of the sides AB or CD and, by b, the length 

Fig 11.9 


...... 


of the sides AD or BC. Therefore, 
Perimeter of a rectangle = length of AB + length of BC + length of CD

 + length of AD 
= 2 × length of CD + 2 × length of BC = 2l + 2b 
The rule, therefore, is that the perimeter of a rectangle = 2l + 2b 
where, l and b are respectively the length and breadth of the rectangle. 
Discuss what happens if l = b. 
If we denote the perimeter of the rectangle by the variable p, the rule for 

perimeter of a rectangle becomes p = 2l + 2b 

Note : Here, both l and b are variables. They take on values 
independent of each other. i.e. the value one variable takes does not 
depend on what value the other variable has taken. 

In your studies of geometry you will come across several rules and formulas 
dealing with perimeters and areas of plane figures, and surface areas and 
volumes of three-dimensional figures. Also, you may obtain formulas for the 
sum of internal angles of a polygon, the number of diagonals of a polygon 
and so on. The concept of variables which you have learnt will prove very 
useful in writing all such general rules and formulas. 

Rules from arithmetic 

3. Commutativity of addition of two numbers 
We know that 

4 + 3 = 7 and 3 + 4 = 7 

i.e. 4 + 3 = 3 + 4 
As we have seen in the chapter on 
whole numbers, this is true for any two 
numbers. This property of numbers is 
known as the commutativity of addition of numbers. Commuting means 
interchanging. Commuting the order of numbers in addition does not change the 
sum. The use of variables allows us to express the generality of this property in a 
concise way. Let a and b be two variables which can take any number value. 

Then, a + b = b + a 
Once we write the rule this way, all special cases are included in it. 
If a = 4 and b = 3, we get 4 + 3 = 3 + 4. If a = 37 and b = 73, 
we get 37 + 73 = 73 + 37 and so on. 

4. Commutativity of multiplication of two numbers 
We have seen in the chapter on whole numbers that for multiplication of 
two numbers, the order of the two numbers being multiplied does not matter. 


...

.......... 



For example, 

4 × 3 = 12, 3 × 4 = 12 

Hence, 4 × 3 = 3 × 4 

This property of numbers is known as commutativity of multiplication 
of numbers. Commuting (interchanging) the order of numbers in 
multiplication does not change the product. Using variables a and b as in the 
case of addition, we can express the commutativity of multiplication of two 
numbers as a × b = b × a 

Note that a and b can take any number value. They are variables. All the 
special cases like 

4 × 3 = 3 × 4 or 37 × 73 = 73 × 37 follow from the general rule. 

5. Distributivity of numbers 
Suppose we are asked to calculate 7 × 38. We obviously do not know the 
table of 38. So, we do the following: 

7 × 38 = 7 × (30 + 8) = 7 × 30 + 7 × 8 = 210 + 56 = 266 

This is always true for any three numbers like 7, 30 and 8. This property is 
known as distributivity of multiplication over addition of numbers. 

By using variables, we can write this property of numbers also in a general 
and concise way. Let a, b and c be three variables, each of which can take any 
number. Then, a × (b + c) = a × b + a × c 

Properties of numbers are fascinating. You will learn many of them in your 
study of numbers this year and in your later study of mathematics. Use of 
variables allows us to express these properties in a very general and concise 
way. One more property of numbers is given in question 5 of Exercise 11.2. Try 
to find more such properties of numbers and learn to express them using variables. 


EXERCISE 11.2 


1. The side of an equilateral triangle is shown by l. Express the 
perimeter of the equilateral triangle using l. 
2. The side of a regular hexagon (Fig 11.10) is denoted by l. 
Express the perimeter of the hexagon using l. 
(Hint : A regular hexagon has all its six sides equal in length.) 


3. A cube is a three-dimensional figure as 
shown in Fig 11.11. It has six faces and all 
of them are identical squares. The length 
of an edge of the cube is given by l. Find the formula for the 
total length of the edges of a cube. 
Fig 11.11 

...

4. The diameter of a circle is a line which joins two points on 
the circle and also passes through the centre of the circle. 
(In the adjoining figure (Fig 11.12) AB is a diameter of the 
circle; C is its centre.) Express the diameter of the circle 
(d) in terms of its radius (r). 
5. To find sum of three numbers 14, 27 and 13, we can have 
two ways: 
(a) We may first add 14 and 27 to get 41 and then add 13 to it to get the total 
sum 54 or 
(b) We may add 27 and 13 to get 40 and then add 14 to get the sum 54. 
Thus, (14 + 27) + 13 = 14 + (27 + 13) 
This can be done for any three numbers. This property is known as the 
associativity of addition of numbers. Express this property which we have already 
studied in the chapter on Whole Numbers, in a general way, by using variables a, b 
and c. 

11.7 Expressions with Variables 
Recall that in arithmetic we have come across expressions like (2 × 10) + 3, 
3 × 100 + (2 × 10) + 4 etc. These expressions are formed from numbers like 2, 
3, 4, 10, 100 and so on. To form expressions we use all the four number 
operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. For example, 
to form (2 × 10) + 3, we have multiplied 2 by 10 and then added 3 to the 
product. Examples of some of the other arithmetic expressions are : 

3 + (4 × 5), (– 3 × 40) + 5, 

8 – (7 × 2), 14 – (5 – 2), 

(6 × 2) – 5, (5 × 7) – (3 × 4), 

7 + (8 × 2) (5 × 7) – (3 × 4 – 7) etc. 

Expressions can be formed from variables too. In fact, we already have 
seen expressions with variables, for example: 2n, 5m, x + 10, x – 3 etc. These 
expressions with variables are obtained by operations of addition, subtraction, 
multiplication and division on variables. For example, the expression 2n is 
formed by multiplying the variable n by 2; the expression (x + 10) is formed 
by adding 10 to the variable x and so on. 

We know that variables can take different values; they have no fixed 
value. But they are numbers. That is why as in the case of numbers, 
operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division can be 
done on them. 

One important point must be noted regarding the expressions 
containing variables. A number expression like (4 × 3) + 5 can be 
immediately evaluated as (4 × 3) + 5 = 12 + 5 = 17 

Fig 11.12 


...

.......... 



But an expression like (4x + 5), which contains the variable x, cannot 
be evaluated. Only if x is given some value, an expression like (4x + 5) can 
be evaluated. For example, 

when x = 3, 4x + 5 = (4 × 3) + 5 = 17 as found above. 

Expression How formed? 

(a) y + 5 5 added to y 
(b) t – 7 7 subtracted from t 
(c) 10 aa multiplied by 10 
x 

(d) x divided by 3
3 

(e) – 5 qq multiplied by –5 
(f) 3 x + 2 first x multiplied by 3, 
then 2 added to the product 
(g) 2 y – 5 first y multiplied by 2, 
then 5 subtracted from the product 
Write 10 other such simple expressions and tell how they have been formed. 
We should also be able to write an expression through given instruction 

about how to form it. Look at the following example : 
Give expressions for the following : 

(a) 12 subtracted from zz – 12 
(b) 25 added to rr + 25 
(c) p multiplied by 16 16 p 
y 

(d) y divided by 8 
8 

(e) m multiplied by –9 – 9 m 
(f) y multiplied by 10 and then 10 y + 7 
7 added to the product 
(g) n multiplied by 2 and 2 n – 1 
1 subtracted from the product 
Sarita and Ameena decide to play a game of 
expressions. They take the variable x and the number 
3 and see how many expressions they can make. The 
condition is that they should use not more than one 
out of the four number operations and every 
expression must have x in it. Can you help them? 

Sarita thinks of (x + 3).

... 


Then, Ameena comes up with (x – 3). 

Is (3x + 5) allowed ? 
Is (3x + 3) allowed ? 



...... 


x 

Next she suggests 3x. Sarita then immediately makes . 

3 

Are these the only four expressions that they can get under the given 
condition? 

Next they try combinations of y, 3 and 5. The condition is that they should 
use not more than one operation of addition or subtraction and one operation 
of multiplication or division. Every expression must have y in it. Check, if 
their answers are right. 

In the following exercise we shall look at how few simple expressions 
have been formed.

1. Make up as many expressions with numbers (no variables) as you can from 
three numbers 5, 7 and 8. Every number should be used not more than once. Use

11.8 Using Expressions Practically 
We have already come across practical situations in which expressions are 
useful. Let us remember some of them. 

Situation (described in 
ordinary language) 
Variable Statements using 
expressions 
1. Sarita has 10 more 
marbles than Ameena. 
Let Ameena 
have x marbles. 
Sarita has 
(x + 10) marbles. 
2. Balu is 3 years 
younger than Raju. 
Let Raju’s age 
be x years. 
Balu’s age is 
(x – 3) years. 
3. Bikash is twice 
as old as Raju. 
Let Raju’s age 
be x years. 
Bikash’s age 
is 2x years. 
4. Raju’s father’s 
age is 2 years more 
than 3 times Raju’s age. 
Let Raju’s age 
be x years. 
Raju’s father's 
age is (3x + 2) 
years. 

Let us look at some other such situations. 

Situation (described in 
ordinary language) 
Variable Statements using 
expressions 
5. How old will Susan 
be 5 years from now? 
Let y be Susan’s 
present age in years. 
Five years from 
now Susan will 
be (y + 5) years old. 
6. How old was Susan 
4 years ago? 
Let y be Susan’s 
present age in years. 
Four years ago, 
Susan was (y – 4) years old. 
7. Price of wheat per kg 
is Rs 5 less 
than price of rice per kg. 
Let price of rice 
per kg be Rs p. 
Price of wheat 
per kg is Rs (p – 5). 

... 



...... 


8. Price of oil per litre 
is 5 times the price of 
rice per kg. 
Let price of rice 
per kg be Rs p. 
Price of oil per 
litre is Rs 5p. 
9. The speed of a bus is 
10 km/hour more than 
the speed of a truck 
going on the same road. 
Let the speed of the 
truck be y km/hour. 
The speed of the 
bus is (y + 10) km/hour. 

Try to find more such situations. You will realise that there are many 
statements in ordinary language, which you will be able to change to 
statements using expressions with variables. In the next section, we shall 
see how we use these statements using expressions for our purpose.

11.9 What is an Equation? 
Let us recall the matchstick pattern of the letter L given in Fig 11.1. For our 
convenience, we have the Fig 11.1 redrawn here. 


The number of matchsticks required for different number of Ls formed 
was given in Table 1. We repeat the table here. 

Table 1 


Number of 
L’s formed 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 ............. 
Number of 
matchsticks 
required 
2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 ............. 

We know that the number of matchsticks required is given by the rule, 
2n, if n is taken to be the number of Ls formed. 
Appu always thinks differently. He asks, “We know how to find the number 

of matchsticks required for a given number of Ls. What about the other way 

... 



...... 


round? How does one find the number of Ls formed, given the number of 

matchsticks”? 
We ask ourselves a definite question. 
How many Ls are formed if the number of matchsticks given is 10? 
This means we have to find the number of Ls ( i.e. n), given the number of 

matchsticks 10. So, 2n = 10 (1) 
Here, we have a condition to be satisfied by the variable n. This condition 
is an example of an equation. 

Our question can be answered by looking at Table 1. Look at various values 
of n. If n = 1, the number of matchsticks is 2. Clearly, the condition is not 
satisfied, because 2 is not 10. We go on checking. 

n 2n Condition satisfied? Yes/No 
2 
3 
4 
5 
6 
7 
4 
6 
8 
10 
12 
14 
No 
No 
No 
Yes 
No 
No 

We find that only if n = 5, the condition, i.e. the equation 2n = 10 is satisfied. 
For any value of n other than 5, the equation is not satisfied. 

Let us look at another equation. 

Balu is 3 years younger than Raju. Taking Raju's age to be x years, Balu’s 
age is (x – 3) years. Suppose, Balu is 11 years old. Then, let us see how our 
method gives Raju’s age. 

We have Balu’s age, x – 3 = 11 (2) 

This is an equation in the variable x. We shall prepare a table of values of 
(x – 3) for various values of x. 

x 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 
x – 3 0 1 – – – – – – – 9 10 11 12 13 – – 

Complete the entries which are left blank. From the table, we find that 
only for x = 14, the condition x – 3 = 11 is satisfied. For other values, 
for example for x = 16 or for x = 12, the condition is not satisfied. Raju’s age, 
therefore, is 14 years. 

To summarise, any equation like the above, is a condition on a variable. 
It is satisfied only for a definite value of the variable. For example, the 

...

.......... 



equation 2n = 10 is satisfied only by the value 5 of the variable n. Similarly, 
the equation x – 3 = 11 is satisfied only by the value 14 of the variable x. 

Note that an equation has an equal sign (=) between its two sides. The 
equation says that the value of the left hand side (LHS) is equal to the value of 
the right hand side (RHS). If the LHS is not equal to the RHS, we do not get 
an equation. 

For example : The statement 2n is greater than 10, i.e. 2n > 10 is not an 

equation. Similarly, the statement 2n is smaller than 10 i.e. 2n < 10 is not an 

equation. Also, the statements 

(x – 3) > 11 or (x – 3) < 11 are not equations. 
Now, let us consider 8 – 3 = 5 
There is an equal sign between the LHS and RHS. Neither of the two sides 

contain a variable. Both contain numbers. We may call this a numerical 
equation. Usually, the word equation is used only for equations with one or 
more variables. 

Let us do an exercise. State which of the following are equations with a 
variable. In the case of equations with a variable, identify the variable. 

(a) x + 20 = 70 (Yes, x) 
(b) 8 × 3 = 24 (No, this a numerical equation) 
(c) 2p > 30 (No) 
(d) n – 4 = 100 (Yes, n) 
(e) 20b = 80 (Yes, b) 
y 

(f) < 50 (No)
8

Following are some examples of an equation. (The variable in the equation 

is also identified). 
Fill in the blanks as required : 
x + 10 = 30 (variable x) (3) 
p – 3 = 7 (variable p) (4) 
3n = 21 (variable ____ ) (5) 

t 

= 4 (variable ____ ) (6)

5

2l + 3 = 7 (variable ____ ) (7) 

2m – 3 = 5 (variable ____ ) (8) 

11.10 Solution of an Equation 
We saw in the earlier section that the equation 
2n = 10 (1)

... 



...... 


was satisfied by n = 5. No other value of n satisfies the equation. The value of 
the variable in an equation which satisfies the equation is called a solution 
to the equation. Thus, n = 5 is a solution to the equation 2 n = 10. 

Note, n = 6 is not a solution to the equation 2n = 10; because for n = 6, 

2n = 2 × 6 = 12 and not 10. 

Also, n = 4 is not a solution. Tell, why not? 

Let us take the equation x – 3 = 11 (2) 

This equation is satisfied by x = 14, because for x = 14, 

LHS of the equation = 14 – 3 = 11 = RHS 

It is not satisfied by x = 16, because for x = 16, 

LHS of the equation = 16 – 3 = 13, which is not equal to RHS. 

Thus, x = 14 is a solution to the equation x – 3 = 11 and x = 16 is not a 
solution to the equation. Also, x = 12 is not a solution to the equation. Explain, 
why not? 
Now complete the entries in the following table and explain why your 
answer is Yes/No. 

In finding the solution to the equation 2n = 10, we prepared a table for 
various values of n and from the table, we picked up the value of n which was 
the solution to the equation (i.e. which satisfies the equation). What we used 
is a trial and error method. It is not a direct and practical way of finding a 

Equation Value of the variable Solution (Yes/No) 
1. x + 10 = 30 x = 10 No 
2. x + 10 = 30 x = 30 No 
3. x + 10 = 30 x = 20 Yes 
4. p – 3 = 7 p = 5 No 
5. p – 3 = 7 p = 15 – 
6. p – 3 = 7 p = 10 –

solution. We need a direct way of solving an equation, i.e. finding the solution 
of the equation. We shall learn a more systematic method of solving equations 
only next year. 


Beginning of Algebra 

It is said that algebra as a branch of Mathematics began about 1550 BC, 

i.e. more than 3500 years ago, when people in Egypt started using symbols 
to denote unknown numbers. 
Around 300 BC, use of letters to denote unknowns and forming 
expressions from them was quite common in India. Many great Indian 
mathematicians, Aryabhatt (born 476AD), Brahmagupta (born 598AD), 
Mahavira (who lived around 850AD) and Bhaskara II (born 1114AD) 
and others, contributed a lot to the study of algebra. They gave names 
such as Beeja, Varna etc. to unknowns and used first letters of colour 
names [e.g., ka from kala (black), nee from neela (blue)] to denote them. 
The Indian name for algebra, Beejaganit, dates back to these ancient 
Indian mathematicians. 

The word ‘algebra’ is derived from the title of the book, ‘Aljebar 
w’al almugabalah’, written about 825AD by an Arab mathematician, 
Mohammed Ibn Al Khowarizmi of Baghdad.

You will still be able to fix! 
(iv) Tell me who I am 
I shall give a pretty clue! 
You will get me back 
If you take me out of twenty two! 
What have we discussed? 

1. We looked at patterns of making letters and other shapes using matchsticks. We 
learnt how to write the general relation between the number of matchsticks 
required for repeating a given shape. The number of times a given shape is 
repeated varies; it takes on values 1,2,3,... . It is a variable, denoted by some 
... 


letter like n. 



...... 


2. A variable takes on different values, its value is not fixed. The length of a square 
can have any value. It is a variable. But the number of angles of a triangle has a 
fixed value 3. It is not a variable. 
3. We may use any letter n, l, m, p, x, y, z, etc. to 
show a variable. 
4. A variable allows us to express relations in 
any practical situation. 
5. Variables are numbers, although their value 
is not fixed. We can do the operations of 
addition, subtraction, multiplication and 
division on them just as in the case of fixed 
numbers. Using different operations we can 
form expressions with variables like x – 3, 
p 

x + 3, 2n, 5m, , 2y + 3, 3l – 5, etc.

3 


6. Variables allow us to express many common rules in both geometry and arithmetic 
in a general way. For example, the rule that the sum of two numbers remains the 
same if the order in which the numbers are taken is reversed can be expressed as 
a + b = b + a. Here, the variables a and b stand for any number, 1, 32, 1000 – 7, 
– 20, etc. 
7. An equation is a condition on a variable. It is expressed by saying that an expression 
with a variable is equal to a fixed number, e.g. x – 3 = 10. 
8. An equation has two sides, LHS and RHS, between them is the equal (=) sign. 
9. The LHS of an equation is equal to its RHS only for a definite value of the 
variable in the equation. We say that this definite value of the variable satisfies 
the equation. This value itself is called the solution of the equation. 
10. For getting the solution of an equation, one method is the trial and error method. 
In this method, we give some value to the variable and check whether it satisfies 
the equation. We go on giving this way different values to the variable` until we 
find the right value which satisfies the equation.

In our daily life, many a times we compare two 
quantities of the same type. For example, Avnee and 
Shari collected flowers for scrap notebook. Avnee 
collected 30 flowers and Shari collected 45 flowers. 
So, we may say that Shari collected 45 – 30 = 15 
flowers more than Avnee. 

Also, if height of Rahim is 150 cm and that of 
Avnee is 140 cm then, we may say that the height of 
Rahim is 150 cm – 140 cm = 10 cm more than Avnee. 
This is one way of comparison by taking difference. 

If we wish to compare the lengths of an ant and a 
grasshopper, taking the difference does not express 
the comparison. The grasshopper’s length, typically 


4 cm to 5 cm is too long as compared to the ant’s 
length which is a few mm. Comparison will be better 
if we try to find that how many ants can be placed 
one behind the other to match the length of 


grasshopper. So, we can say that 20 to 30 ants have 

the same length as a grasshopper. 

Consider another example. 

Cost of a car is Rs 2,50,000 and that of a motorbike is Rs 50,000. If we 
calculate the difference between the costs, it is Rs 2,00,000 and if we compare 

2,50,000 5 

=

by division; i.e. 

50,000 1 


|............... 


We can say that the cost of the car is five times the cost of the motorbike. 
Thus, in certain situations, comparison by division makes better sense than 
comparison by taking the difference. The comparison by division is the Ratio. 
In the next section, we shall learn more about ‘Ratios’. 

12.2 Ratio 
Consider the following: 

Isha’s weight is 25 kg and her father’s weight is 75 kg. How many times 
Father’s weight is of Isha’s weight? It is three times. 

Cost of a pen is Rs 10 and cost of a pencil is Rs 2. How many times the cost of 
a pencil is the cost of a pen? Obviously it is five times. 

In the above examples, we compared the two quantities in terms of 

‘how many times’. This comparison is known as the Ratio. We denote 

ratio using symbol ‘:’ 

Consider the earlier examples again. We can say, 

75 3 

The ratio of father’s weight to Isha’s weight = = = 3:1 

251

10 5 

The ratio of the cost of a pen to the cost of a pencil = = =5:1 

21 

1. In a class, there are 
20 boys and 40 
girls. What is the 
ratio of the number 
of boys to the 
number of girls? 
2. Ravi walks 6 km 
in an hour while 
Roshan walks 
4 km in an hour. 
What is the ratio 
of the distance 
covered by Ravi 
to the distance 
covered by Roshan? 
Let us look at this problem. 
In a class, there are 20 boys and 40 girls. What is the ratio of 

(a) Number of girls to the total number of students. 
(b) Number of boys to the total number of students. 
First we need to find the total number of students, 
which is, 
Number of girls + Number of boys = 20 + 40 = 60. 
Then, the ratio of number of girls to the total 

number of students is 
40 
= 
2 
. 
603 

Find the answer of part (b) in the similar manner. 
Now consider the following example. 
Length of a house lizard is 20 cm and the length 

of a crocodile is 4 m. 

“I am 5 
times bigger 
than you”, says 
the lizard. As 
we can see this 

...
I am bigger 
You are smaller 

.......... 



is really absurd. A lizard’s length cannot be 5 times of the length of a crocodile. 
So, what is wrong? Observe that the length of the lizard is in centimetres and 
length of the crocodile is in metres. So, we have to convert their lengths into 
the same unit. 

Length of the crocodile = 4 m = 4 × 100 = 400 cm. 

Therefore, ratio of the length of the crocodile to the length of the lizard 

400 20 

= == : .

20 1

20 1 

Two quantities can be compared only if they are in the same unit. 

Now what is the ratio of the length of the lizard to the length of the crocodile? 

20 1 

It is = 120.

= : 

400 20 

Observe that the two ratios 1 : 20 and 20 : 1 are different from each other. 
The ratio 1 : 20 is the ratio of the length of the lizard to the length of the 
crocodile whereas, 20 : 1 is the ratio of the length of the crocodile to the 
length of the lizard. 

Now consider another example. 

Length of a pencil is 18 cm and its 
diameter is 8 mm. What is the ratio of 
the diameter of the pencil to that of its 
length? Since the length and the 
diameter of the pencil are given in 
different units, we first need to convert 
them into same unit. 

Thus, length of the pencil = 18 cm 
= 18 × 10 mm = 180 mm. 

The ratio of the diameter of the 
pencil to that of the length of the pencil 

82 

= = =2:45. 

180 45 

Think of some 


more situations 

where you compare 

two quantities of same type in different units. 

We use the concept of ratio in many situations of our 

daily life without realising that we do so. 

Compare the drawings A and B. B looks more natural 

AB 

than A. Why? 


1. Saurabh takes 15 minutes to reach 
school from his house and Sachin 
takes one hour to reach school 
from his house. Find the ratio of 
the time taken by Saurabh to the 
time taken by Sachin. 
2. Cost of a toffee is 50 paise and 
cost of a chocolate is Rs 10. Find 
the ratio of the cost of a toffee to 
the cost of a chocolate. 
3. In a school, there were 73 
holidays in one year. What is the 
ratio of the number of holidays 
to the number of days in one year? 
...

The legs in the picture A are too long in comparison to the other body 
parts. This is because we normally expect a certain ratio of the length of legs 
to the length of whole body. 

Compare the two pictures of a pencil. Is the 
first one looking like a full pencil? No. 

Why not? The reason is that the thickness and 
the length of the pencil are not in the correct ratio. 

Same ratio in different situations : 

Consider the following : 
.Length of a room is 30 m and its breadth is 20 m. So, the ratio of length of 

30 3 

the room to the breadth of the room = = =3:2 

20 2 

.There are 24 girls and 16 boys going for a picnic. Ratio of the number of 

24 3 

girls to the number of boys = = =3:2 

16 2 


The ratio in both the examples is 3 : 2. 

.

Note the ratios 30 : 20 and 24 : 16 in lowest form are same as 3 : 2. These 
are equivalent ratios. 

.Can you think of some more examples having the ratio 3 : 2? 
It is fun to write situations that give rise to a certain ratio. For example, 
write situations that give the ratio 2 : 3. 

.Ratio of the breadth of a table to the length of the table is 2 : 3. 
.
Sheena has 2 marbles and her friend Shabnam has 3 marbles. 
Then, the ratio of marbles that Sheena and Shabnam have is 2 : 3. 
Can you write some more situations for this ratio? Give any ratio to your 
friends and ask them to frame situations. 
Ravi and Rani started a business and 
invested money in the ratio 2 : 3. After one 
year the total profit was Rs 40,000. 
Ravi said “we would divide it equally”, 
Rani said “I should get more as I have invested 
more”. 
It was then decided that profit will be 
divided in the ratio of their investment. 
Here, the two terms of the ratio 2 : 3 are 2 and 3. 
Sum of these terms = 2 + 3 = 5 
What does this mean? 
This means if the profit is Rs 5 then Ravi should get Rs 2 and Rani should 
get Rs 3. Or, we can say that Ravi gets 2 parts and Rani gets 3 parts out of the 
5 parts. 


...

.......... 



23 

i.e., Ravi should get of the total profit and Rani should get of the 

55 

total profit. 

If the total profit were Rs 500 

2 

Ravi would get Rs × 500 = Rs 200 

5 
3 

and Rani would get × 500 = Rs 300 

5 

Now, if the profit were Rs 40,000, could you find the share of each? 

2 

Ravi’s share = Rs 40000 = Rs 16,000.

5 
3 

And Rani’s share = Rs 40000 = Rs 24,000.

Can you think of some more examples where you have to divide a number 
of things in some ratio? Frame three such examples and ask your friends to 
solve them. 

Let us look at the kind of problems we have solved so far. 

1. Find the ratio of number of notebooks to the number of 
books in your bag. 
2. Find the ratio of number of desks and chairs in your 
classroom. 
3. Find the number of students above twelve years of age in your class. 
Then, find the ratio of number of students with age above twelve years 
and the remaining students. 
4. Find the ratio of number of doors and the number of windows in your 
classroom. 
5. Draw any rectangle and find the ratio of its length to its breadth. 
Example 1 : Length and breadth of a rectangular field are 50 m and 15 m 
respectively. Find the ratio of the length to the breadth of the field. 

Solution : Length of the rectangular field = 50 m 
Breadth of the rectangular field = 15 m 
The ratio of the length to the breadth is 50 : 15 

50 50 5 10 

The ratio can be written as = = = 10 : 3 

1515 53

... 


Thus, the required ratio is 10 : 3. 


|............... 


Example 2 : Find the ratio of 90 cm to 1.5 m. 

Solution : The two quantities are not in the same units. Therefore, we have to 
convert them into same units. 

1.5 m = 1.5 × 100 cm = 150 cm. 
Therefore, the required ratio is 90 : 150. 
90 90 30 3 

=

= = 

150150 305 

Required ratio is 3 : 5. 

Example 3 : There are 45 persons working in an office. If the number of 
females is 25 and the remaining are males, find the ratio of : 

(a) The number of females to number of males. 
(b) The number of males to number of females. 
Solution : Number of females = 25 

Total number of workers = 45 

Number of males = 45 – 25 = 20 

Therefore, the ratio of number of females to the number of males 

= 25 : 20 = 5 : 4 

And the ratio of number of males to the number of females 

= 20 : 25 = 4 : 5. 

(Notice that there is a difference between the two ratios 5 : 4 and 4 : 5). 

Example 4 : Give two equivalent ratios of 6 : 4. 

6 6 2 12 

Solution : Ratio 6 : 4 = = = . 

44 28 

Therefore, 12 : 8 is an equivalent ratio of 6 : 4 

66 2 3 

Similarly, the ratio 6 : 4 = == 

44 2 2 

So, 3:2 is another equivalent ratio of 6 : 4. 

Therefore, we can get equivalent ratios by multiplying or dividing the 
numerator and denominator by the same number. 

Write two more equivalent ratios of 6 : 4. 

Example 5 : Fill in the missing numbers : 


Solution : In order to get the first missing number, we consider the fact that 
21 = 3 × 7. i.e. when we divide 21 by 7 we get 3. This indicates that to get the 
missing number of second ratio, 14 must also be divided by 7. 

When we divide, we have, 14 ÷ 7 = 2 

...

.......... 


2

Hence, the second ratio is . 

3 

Similarly, to get third ratio we multiply both terms of second ratio by 3. 
(Why? ) 

6 

Hence, the third ratio is 

9 


14 2 6 
Therefore, = 
21 3 
=
9 
[These are all equivalent ratios.] 

Example 6 : Ratio of distance of the school from Mary’s home to the distance 
of the school from John’s home is 2 : 1. 

(a) Who lives nearer to the school? 
(b) Complete the following table which shows some possible distances that 
Mary and John could live from the school. 
Distance from Mary’s home to school (in km.) 10 4 
Distance from John’s home to school (in km.) 5 4 3 1 
(c) If the ratio of distance of Mary’s home to the distance of Kalam’s home 
from school is 1 : 2, then who lives nearer to the school? 
Solution : (a)John lives nearer to the school (As the ratio is 2 : 1). 

(b) 

Distance from Mary’s home to school (in km.) 10 8 4 6 2 
Distance from John’s home to school (in km.) 5 4 2 3 1 
(c) Since the ratio is 1 : 2, so Mary lives nearer to the school. 
Example 7 : Divide Rs 60 in the ratio 1 : 2 between Kriti and Kiran. 

Solution : The two parts are 1 and 2. 

Therefore, sum of the parts = 1 + 2 = 3. 

This means if there are Rs 3, Kriti will get Re 1 and Kiran will get Rs 2. 

Or, we can say that Kriti gets 1 part and Kiran gets 2 parts out of every 3 parts. 

1 

Therefore, Kriti’s share = 60 = Rs 20 

3 
2 

And Kiran’s share = 60 = Rs 40.

(c) Age of father after 10 years to the age of son after 10 years. 
(d) Age of father to the age of son when father was 30 years old. 
12.3 Proportion 
Consider this situation : 

Raju went to the market to purchase tomatoes. One shopkeeper tells him 
that the cost of tomatoes is Rs 40 for 5 kg. Another shopkeeper gives the cost as 
6 kg for Rs 42. Now, what should Raju do? Should he purchase tomatoes from 
the first shopkeeper or from the second? Will the comparison by taking the 
difference help him decide? No. Why not? 

Think of some way to help him. Discuss with your friends. 
Consider another example. 
Bhavika has 28 marbles and Vini has 180 flowers. They want to share 

... 


these among themselves. Bhavika gave 14 marbles to Vini and Vini gave 90 



|............... 



flowers to Bhavika. But Vini was not satisfied. 
She felt that she had given more flowers to 
Bhavika than the marbles given by Bhavika 
to her. 

What do you think? Is Vini correct? 

To solve this problem both went to Vini’s 
mother Pooja. 

Pooja explained that out of 28 marbles, 
Bhavika gave 14 marbles to Vini. 

Therefore, ratio is 14 : 28 = 1 : 2. 

And out of 180 flowers, Vini had given 90 flowers to Bhavika. 

Therefore, ratio is 90 : 180 = 1 : 2. 

Since both the ratios are the same, so the distribution is fair. 

Two friends Ashma and Pankhuri went to market to purchase hair clips. 
They purchased 20 hair clips for Rs 30. Ashma gave Rs 12 and Pankhuri gave 
Rs 18. After they came back home, Ashma asked Pankhuri to give 10 hair 
clips to her. But Pankhuri said, “since I have given more money so I should 
get more clips. You should get 8 hair clips and I should get 12”. 

Can you tell who is correct, Ashma or Pankhuri? Why? 

Ratio of money given by Ashma to the money given by Pankhuri 

= Rs 12 : Rs 18 = 2 : 3 

According to Ashma’s suggestion, the ratio of the number of hair clips for 
Ashma to the number of hair clips for Pankhuri = 10 : 10 = 1 : 1 

According to Pankhuri’s suggestion, the ratio of the number of hair clips 
for Ashma to the number of hair clips for Pankhuri = 8 : 12 = 2 : 3 

Now, notice that according to Ashma’s distribution, ratio of hair clips and 
the ratio of money given by them is not the same. But according to the 
Pankhuri’s distribution the two ratios are the same. 

Hence, we can say that Pankhuri’s distribution is correct. 

Sharing a ratio means something! 

Consider the following examples : 

. 
Raj purchased 3 pens for Rs 15 and Anu purchased 10 pens for Rs 50. 
Whose pens are more expensive? 
Ratio of number of pens purchased by Raj to the number of pens purchased 
by Anu = 3 : 10. 
Ratio of their costs = 15 : 50 = 3 : 10 
Both the ratios 3 : 10 and 15 : 50 are equal. Therefore, the pens were 
purchased for the same price by both. 
...

.......... 


.Rahim sells 2 kg of apples for Rs 60 and Roshan sells 4 kg of apples for 
Rs 120. Whose apples are more expensive? 
Ratio of the weight of apples = 2 kg : 4 kg = 1 : 2 
Ratio of their cost = Rs 60 : Rs 120 = 6 : 12 = 1 : 2 


So, the ratio of weight of apples = ratio of their cost. 
Since both the ratios are equal, hence, we say that they 
are in proportion. They are selling apples at the same rate. 


If two ratios are equal, we say that they are in proportion and use the 
symbol ‘::’ or ‘=’ to equate the two ratios. 

For the first example, we can say 3, 10, 15 and 50 are in 
proportion which is written as 3 : 10 :: 15 : 50 and is read as 
3 is to 10 as 15 is to 50 or it is written as 3 : 10 = 15 : 50. 

For the second example, we can say 2, 4, 60 and 120 are 
in proportion which is written as 2 : 4 :: 60 : 120 and is read 
as 2 is to 4 as 60 is to 120. 

Let us consider another example. 

A man travels 35 km in 2 hours. With the same speed 
would he be able to travel 70 km in 4 hours? 

Now, ratio of the two distances travelled by the man is 35 to 
70 = 1 : 2 and the ratio of the time taken to cover these distances is 2 to 4 = 1 : 2 . 

Hence, the two ratios are equal i.e. 35 : 70 = 2 : 4. 

Therefore, we can say that the four 
numbers 35, 70, 2 and 4 are in proportion. 

Hence, we can write it as 35 : 70 :: 2 : 4 
and read it as 35 is to 70 as 

2 is to 4. Hence, he can travel 70 km in 4 
hours with that speed. 

Now, consider this example. 

Cost of 2 kg of apples is Rs 60 and a 5 kg 
watermelon costs Rs 15. 

Now, ratio of the weight of apples to the 
weight of watermelon is 2 : 5. 

And ratio of the cost of apples to the cost 
of the watermelon is 60 : 15 = 4 : 1. 

Here, the two ratios 2 : 5 and 60 : 15 are not equal, 

i.e. 2 : 5  60 : 15 
Therefore, the four quantities 2, 5, 60 and 15 are not in proportion. 
Check whether the given 
ratios are equal, i.e. they are 
in proportion. 
If yes, then write them in 
the proper form. 
1. 1 : 5 and 3 : 15 
2. 2 : 9 and 18 : 81 
3. 15 : 45 and 5 : 25 
4. 4 : 12 and 9 : 27 
5. Rs 10 to Rs 15 and 4 to 6 
... 



|............... 


If two ratios are not equal, then we say that they are not in proportion. 
In a statement of proportion, the four quantities involved when taken in 
order are known as respective terms. First and fourth terms are known 
as extreme terms. Second and third terms are known as middle terms. 

For example, in 35 : 70 : : 2 : 4; 
35, 70, 2, 4 are the four terms. 35 and 4 are the extreme terms. 70 and 2 are 
the middle terms. 

Example 8 : Are the ratios 25g : 30g and 40 kg : 48 kg in proportion? 

25 

Solution : 25 g : 30 g = = 5 : 6 

3040 

40 kg : 48 kg = = 5 : 6 So, 25 : 30 = 40 : 48.

48

Therefore, the ratios 25 g : 30 g and 40 kg : 48 kg are in proportion, 

i.e. 25 : 30 :: 40 : 48 
The middle terms in this are 30, 40 and the extreme terms are 25, 48. 
Example 9 : Are 30, 40, 45 and 60 in proportion? 

30 

Solution : Ratio of 30 to 40 = = 3 : 4. 

40 

45 

Ratio of 45 to 60 = = 3 : 4. 

60

Since, 30 : 40 = 45 : 60. 
Therefore, 30, 40, 45, 60 are in proportion. 

Example 10 : Do the ratios 15 cm to 2 m and 10 sec to 3 minutes form a 
proportion? 

Solution : Ratio of 15 cm to 2 m = 15 : 2 × 100 (1 m = 100 cm) 
= 3 : 40 
Ratio of 10 sec to 3 min = 10 : 3 × 60 (1 min = 60 sec) 
= 1 : 18 
Since, 3 : 40  1 : 18, therefore, the given ratios do not form a proportion. 


EXERCISE 12.2 

1. Determine if the following are in proportion. 
(a) 15, 45, 40, 120 (b) 33, 121, 9,96 (c) 24, 28, 36, 48

(c)2 kg : 80 kg and 25 g : 625 g (d)200 ml : 2.5 litre and Rs 4 : Rs 50 
12.4 Unitary Method 
Consider the following situations: 
.Two friends Reshma and Seema went to market to purchase 
notebooks. Reshma purchased 2 notebooks for Rs 24. What is 
the price of one notebook? 

.A scooter requires 2 litres of petrol to cover 80 km. How many 
litres of petrol is required to cover 1 km? 
These are examples of the kind of situations that we 

face in our daily life. How would you solve these? 
Reconsider the first example: Cost of 2 notebooks is 

Rs 24. 
Therefore, cost of 1 notebook = Rs 24 2 = Rs 12. 
Now, if you were asked to find cost of 5 such notebooks. It would be 
= Rs 12 × 5 = Rs 60 
Reconsider the second example: We want to know how many litres are 

needed to travel 1 km. 
For 80 km, petrol needed = 2 litres. 

21 

Therefore, to travel 1 km, petrol needed = = litres. 

80 40

Now, if you are asked to find how many litres of petrol are required to cover 
120 km? 

1

Then petrol needed = ×120 litres = 3 litres. 

40 

The method in which first we find the value of one unit and then the 
value of required number of units is known as Unitary Method. 


...

1. Prepare five similar problems and ask your friends to solve them. 
2. Read the table and fill in the boxes. 
Time Distance travelled by Karan Distance travelled by Kriti 
2 hours 8 km 6 km 
1 hour 4 km 
4 hours 


We see that, 
Distance travelled by Karan in 2 hours = 8 km 

8 

Distance travelled by Karan in 1 hour = km = 4 km 

2

Therefore, distance travelled by Karan in 4 hours = 4 × 4 = 16 km 
Similarly, to find the distance travelled by Kriti in 4 hours, first find the 
distance travelled by her in 1 hour. 

Example 11 : If the cost of 6 cans of juice is Rs 210, then what will be the 
cost of 4 cans of juice? 

Solution : Cost of 6 cans of juice = Rs 210 

210 

Therefore, cost of one can of juice = = Rs 35 

6

Therefore, cost of 4 cans of juice = Rs 35 × 4 = Rs 140. 
Thus, cost of 4 cans of juice is Rs 140. 

Example 12 : A motorbike travels 220 km in 5 litres of petrol. How much 
distance will it cover in 1.5 litres of petrol? 

Solution : In 5 litres of petrol, motorbike can travel 220 km. 

220 

Therefore, in 1 litre of petrol, motor bike travels = km 

5220 

.

Therefore, in 1.5 litres, motorbike travels = ×15 km 

5 


220 15 
= × km = 66 km. 
5 10 

Thus, the motorbike can travel 66 km in 1.5 litres of petrol. 

Example 13 : If the cost of a dozen soaps is Rs 153.60, what will be the cost 
of 15 such soaps? 

Solution : We know that 1 dozen = 12 
Since, cost of 12 soaps = Rs 153.60 

...

.......... 



153.60 

Therefore, cost of 1 soap = = Rs 12.80 

12

Therefore, cost of 15 soaps = Rs 12.80 × 15 = Rs 192 
Thus, cost of 15 soaps is Rs 192. 

Example 14 : Cost of 105 envelopes is Rs 35. How many envelopes can be 
purchased for Rs 10? 
Solution : In Rs 35, the number of envelopes that can be purchased = 105 

105 

Therefore, in Re 1, number of envelopes that can be purchased = 

Therefore, in Rs 10, the number of envelopes that can be 

105 

purchased = × 10 = 30 

35

Thus, 30 envelopes can be purchased for Rs 10. 

1 

Example 15 : A car travels 90 km in 2 hours. 

2

(a) How much time is required to cover 30 km with the same speed? 
(b) Find the distance covered in 2 hours with the same speed. 
Solution : (a) In this case, time is unknown and distance is known. Therefore, 
we proceed as follows : 

1 55 

2 hours = hours = × 60 minutes = 150 minutes. 

222 

90 km is covered in 150 minutes 

150 

Therefore, 1 km can be covered in minutes 

90 

150 

Therefore, 30 km can be covered in × 30 minutes i.e. 50 minutes 

90

Thus, 30 km can be covered in 50 minutes. 

(b) In this case, distance is unknown and time is known. Therefore, we 
proceed as follows : 
15 

Distance covered in 2 hours (i.e. hours) = 90 km

22 
52 

Therefore, distance covered in 1 hour = 90 km = 90 × = 36 km 

25 

Therefore, distance covered in 2 hours = 36 × 2 = 72 km. 
Thus, in 2 hours, distance covered is 72 km.

11. Anish made 42 runs in 6 overs and Anup made 63 runs in 7 overs. Who made 
more runs per over? 
What have we discussed? 

1. For comparing quantities of the same type, we commonly use the method of 
taking difference between the quantities. 
2. In many situations, a more meaningful comparison between quantities is made 
by using division, i.e. by seeing how many times one quantity is to the other 
quantity. This method is known as comparison by ratio. 
For example, Isha’s weight is 25 kg and her father’s weight is 75 kg. We 
say that Isha’s father’s weight and Isha’s weight are in the ratio 3 : 1. 

3. For comparison by ratio, the two quantities must be in the same unit. If they are 
not, they should be expressed in the same unit before the ratio is taken. 
4. The same ratio may occur in different situations. 
5. Note that the ratio 3 : 2 is different from 2 : 3. Thus, the order in which quantities 
are taken to express their ratio is important. 
...

.......... 



10 

6. A ratio may be treated as a fraction, thus the ratio 10 : 3 may be treated as . 
3 

7. Two ratios are equivalent, if the fractions corresponding to them are equivalent. 
Thus, 3 : 2 is equivalent to 6 : 4 or 12 : 8. 
8. A ratio can be expressed in its lowest form. For example, ratio 50 : 15 is treated 
50 50 10 
as ; in its lowest form15 15 
= 
3 
. Hence, the lowest form of the ratio 50 : 15 
is 10 : 3. 

9. Four quantities are said to be in proportion, if the ratio of the first and the 
second quantities is equal to the ratio of the third and the fourth quantities. 
3 15 

Thus, 3, 10, 15, 50 are in proportion, since = . We indicate the 

10 50 

proportion by 3 : 10 :: 15 : 50, it is read as 3 is to 10 as 15 is to 50. In the 
above proportion, 3 and 50 are the extreme terms and 10 and 15 are the 
middle terms. 

10. The order of terms in the proportion is important. 3, 10, 15 and 50 are in 
3 50 

proportion, but 3, 10, 50 and 15 are not, since is not equal to . 

1015 

11. The method in which we first find the value of one unit and then the value of 
the required number of units is known as the unitary method. Suppose the 
cost of 6 cans is Rs 210. To find the cost of 4 cans, using the unitary method, 
210 

we first find the cost of 1 can. It is Rs or Rs 35. From this, we find the 

6

price of 4 cans as Rs 35 × 4 or Rs 140.

Symmetry is quite a common term used in day to day life. When we see 
certain figures with evenly balanced proportions, we say, “They are 
symmetrical”. 

Tajmahal (U.P.) 
These pictures of architectural marvel are beautiful 
because of their symmetry. 

Suppose we could fold a picture in half such that the 
left and right halves match exactly then the picture is said 
to have line symmetry (Fig 13.1). We can see that the two 
halves are mirror images of each other. If we place a mirror 
on the fold then the image of one side of the picture will 
fall exactly on the other side of the picture. When it happens, 
the fold, which is the mirror line, is a line of symmetry (or 
an axis of symmetry) for the picture. 

Thiruvannamalai (Tamil Nadu) 
Fig 13.1 


.......... 


The shapes you see here are symmetrical. Why? 
When you fold them along the dotted line, one half of 

the drawing would fit exactly over the other half. 
How do you name the dotted line in the figure? 
Where will you place the mirror for having the image 

exactly over the other half of the picture? 
The adjacent figure 13.2 is not symmetrical. 
Can you tell ‘why not’? 

13.2 Making Symmetric Figures : Ink-blot Devils 
Fig 13.2 


DoThis
Take a piece of paper. Fold it in half. 

Spill a few drops of ink on one half side. 

Now press the halves together. 

What do you see? 

Is the resulting figure symmetric? If yes, where is 
the line of symmetry? Is there any other line along which 
it can be folded to produce two identical parts? 

Try more such patterns. 

Inked-string patterns 


Fold a paper in half. On one half-portion, arrange short lengths of string 
dipped in a variety of coloured inks or paints. Now press the two halves. 
Study the figure you obtain. Is it symmetric? In how many ways can it be 
folded to produce two identical halves? 

List a few objects you find in your class 
room such as the black board, the table, the 
wall, the textbook, etc. Which of them are 
symmetric and which are not? Can you identify 
the lines of symmetry for those objects which 
are symmetric? 

You have two set-squares 
in your ‘mathematical 
instruments box’. Are they 
symmetric?

A kite 

One of the two set-squares in your instrument box has angles of measure 30°, 
60°, 90°. 
Take two such identical set-squares. Place them side by side 

to form a ‘kite’, like the one shown here. 
How many lines of symmetry does the shape have? 
Do you think that some shapes may have more than one line 

of symmetry? 

A rectangle 


Take a rectangular sheet (like a post-card). Fold it once lengthwise so that one 

half fits exactly over the other half. Is this fold a line of symmetry? Why? 
Open it up now and 
again fold on its 
width in the same 
way. Is this second 
fold also a line of 

1st fold symmetry? Why?

Form as many 
shapes as you 
can by 
combining two 
or more set 
squares. Draw

paper and note 
their lines of 
symmetry. 
Do you find that these two lines are the lines of 
symmetry? 

A cut out from double fold 

Take a rectangular piece of paper. Fold 
it once and then once more. Draw 
some design as shown. Cut the shape 
drawn and unfold the shape. (Before 
unfolding, try to guess the shape you 
are likely to get). 

How many lines of symmetry 

does the shape have which has been 

cut out? 

Create more such designs.

13.4 Figures with Multiple (more than two) Lines of Symmetry 
Take a square piece of paper. Fold it into half vertically, 
fold it again into half horizontally. (i.e. you have folded 
it twice). Now open out the folds and again fold the 
square into half (for a third time now), but this time 
along a diagonal, as shown in the figure. Again open it 
and fold it into half (for the fourth time), but this time 
along the other diagonal, as shown in the figure. Open 
out the fold. 

How many lines of symmetry does the shape have? 

We can also learn to construct figures with two lines of symmetry starting 
from a small part as you did in Exercise 13.1, question 4, for figures with one 
line of symmetry.

with two lines of symmetry. Let the two lines 
of symmetry be A and B. 
3. We draw the part as shown to get a figure having 
line A as a line of symmetry. 
...

.......... 


4. To complete the figure we need it to be 
symmetrical about line B also. Draw the 
remaining part of figure as shown. 
This figure has two lines of symmetry i.e. line A 
and line B. 
Try taking similar pieces and adding to them so 
that the figure has two lines of symmetry. 
Some shapes have only one line of symmetry; some have two lines of 
symmetry; and some have three or more. 
Can you think of a figure that has six lines of symmetry? 


Symmetry, symmetry everywhere!

8. Given here are figures of a few 
folded sheets and designs drawn 
about the fold. In each case, draw a 
rough diagram of the complete 
figure that would be seen when the 
design is cut off. 
13.5 Reflection and Symmetry 
Line symmetry and mirror reflection are naturally related and linked to each 
other. 

Here is a picture showing the reflection of the English letter M. You can 
imagine that the mirror is invisible and can just see the letter M and its image. 

...

.......... 


The object and its image are symmetrical with reference 
to the mirror line. If the paper is folded, the mirror line 
becomes the line of symmetry. We then say that the image is 
the reflection of the object in the mirror line. You can also 
see that when an object is reflected, there is no change in the 
lengths and angles; i.e. the lengths and angles of the object 
and the corresponding lengths and angles of the image are 
the same. However, in one aspect there is a change, i.e. there 
is a difference between the object and the image. Can you 
guess what the difference is? 

(Hint : Look yourself into a mirror). 


DoThis
On a squared sheet, draw the figure ABC and find its 

mirror image A'B'C' with l as the mirror line. 

Compare the lengths of 

AB and A' B'; BC and B' C'; AC and A' C'. 

Are they different? 

Does reflection change length of a line segment? 

Compare the measures of the angles (use protractor 
to measure) ABC and A'B'C'. 

Does reflection change the size of an angle? 

Join AA', BB' and CC'. Use your protractor to measure the angles between 
the lines l and AA', l and BB', l and CC'. 

What do you conclude about the angle between the mirror line l and the 
line segment joining a point and its reflected image? 


If you are 100 cm in 
front of a mirror, 
where does your 
image appear to be? 
If you move towards 
the mirror, how does 
your image move? 
Paper decoration 

Use thin rectangular 
coloured paper. Fold it 
several times and create 
some intricate patterns by 
cutting the paper, like the 
one shown here. Identify 
the line symmetries in the 
repeating design. Use such 
decorative paper cut-outs 
for festive occasions.

Kaleidoscope 

Broken bangles Tape 
Cardboard 
Mirror 
Patterns formed in Kaleidoscope 
A kaleidoscope uses mirrors to produce 
images that have several lines of 
symmetry (as shown here for example). 
Usually, two mirrors strips forming a V-
shape are used. The angle between the 
mirrors determines the number of lines 
of symmetry. 
Make a kaleidoscope and try to learn more about the symmetric images 

produced. 

Album 

Collect symmetrical designs you come across and prepare an album. 
Here are a few samples. 


An application of reflectional symmetry 

A paper-delivery boy wants to park his cycle at 
some point P and deliver the newspapers to 
houses A and B. Where should he park the cycle 
so that his walking distance AP + BP will be least? 

You can use reflectional symmetry here. Let 
A' be the image of A in the mirror line which is 
the street here. Then the point P is the ideal place 
to park the cycle (where the mirror line and A' B 


meet). Can you say why?

Rangoli patterns 

Kolams and Rangoli are popular in our country. A few samples are given here. 
Note the use of symmetry in them. Collect as many patterns as possible of 
these and prepare an album. 

Try and locate symmetric portions of these patterns alongwith the lines of 
symmetry. 


What have we discussed? 

1. A figure has line symmetry if a line can be drawn dividing the figure into two 
identical parts. The line is called a line of symmetry. 
2. A figure may have no line of symmetry, only one line of symmetry, two lines of 
symmetry or multiple lines of symmetry. Here are some examples. 
Number of lines of symmetry Example 
No line of symmetry 
Only one line of symmetry 
Two lines of symmetry 
Three lines of symmetry 
A scalene triangle 
An isosceles triangle 
A rectangle 
An equilateral triangle 

3. The line symmetry is closely related to mirror reflection. When dealing with 
mirror reflection, we have to take into account the left  right changes in 
orientation. 
Symmetry has plenty of applications in everyday life as in art, architecture, textile 
technology, design creations, geometrical reasoning, Kolams, Rangoli etc.

We see a number of shapes with which we are familiar. We also make a lot of 
pictures. These pictures include different shapes. We have learnt about some of 
these shapes in earlier chapters as well. Why don’t you list those shapes that 
you know about alongwith how they appear? 

In this chapter we shall learn to make these shapes. In making these shapes 
we need to use some tools. We shall begin with listing these tools, describing 
them and looking at how they are used.

We are going to consider “Ruler and compasses constructions”, using 
ruler, only to draw lines, and compasses, only to draw arcs. 

Be careful while doing these constructions. 

Here are some tips to help you. 

(a) Draw thin lines and mark points lightly. 
(b) Maintain instruments with sharp tips and fine edges. 
(c) Have two pencils in the box, one for insertion into the compasses and 
the other to draw lines or curves and mark points. 
...

14.2 The Circle 
Look at the wheel shown here. Every point on its boundary 
is at an equal distance from its centre. Can you mention a 
few such objects and draw them? Think about five such 
objects which have this shape. 

14.2.1 Construction of a circle when its radius is known 
Suppose we want to draw a circle of radius 3 cm. We need to use our compasses. 
Here are the steps to follow. 
Step 1 Open the 
compasses for the 
required radius of 3cm. 

Step 2 Mark a point 
with a sharp pencil 
where we want the 
centre of the circle to 
be. Name it as O. 
Step 3 Place the pointer of the compasses on O. 


Step 4 Turn the compasses slowly to draw the circle. Be careful to complete 
the movement around in one instant. 

Think, discuss and write 

How many circles can you draw with a given centre O and a point, say P? 


EXERCISE 14.1 

1. Draw a circle of radius 3.2 cm. 
2. With the same centre O, draw two circles of radii 4 cm and 2.5 cm. 
3. Draw a circle and any two of its diameters. If you join the ends of these diameters, 
what is the figure obtained? What figure is obtained if the diameters are 
perpendicular to each other? How do you check your answer? 
4. Draw any circle and mark points A, B and C such that 
(a) A is on the circle. (b) B is in the interior of the circle. 
(c) C is in the exterior of the circle. 
5. Let A, B be the centres of two circles of equal radii; draw them so that each one 
of them passes through the centre of the other. Let them intersect at C and D. 
Examine whether AB and CD are at right angles.

... 




|...........|. 


14.3 A Line Segment 
Remember that a line segment is bounded by two end-points. This makes it 
possible to measure its length with a ruler. 

If we know the length of a line segment, it becomes possible to represent 
it by a diagram. Let us see how we do this. 

14.3.1 Construction of a line segment of a given length 
Suppose we want to draw a line segment of length 4.7 cm. We can use our 

ruler and mark two points A and B which are 4.7 cm apart. Join A and B and 
get AB . While marking the points A and B, we should look straight down at 
the measuring device. Otherwise we will get an incorrect value. 

Use of ruler and compasses 

A better method would be to use compasses to construct a line segment of a 
given length. 
Step 1 Draw a line l. Mark a point A on a line l. 


Step 2 Place the compasses pointer on the zero mark 
of the ruler. Open it to place the pencil point upto 
the 4.7cm mark. 


Step 3 Taking caution that the opening of the 
compasses has not changed, place the pointer on 
A and swing an arc to cut l at B. 

l 

Step 4 AB is a line segment of required length. 

...

EXERCISE 14.2 

1. Draw a line segment of length 7.3 cm using a ruler. 
2. Construct a line segment of length 5.6 cm using ruler and compasses. 
3. Construct AB of length 7.8 cm. From this, cut off AC of length 4.7 cm. Measure 
BC . 
4. Given AB of length 3.9 cm, construct PQ such that the length of PQ is twice 
that of AB . Verify by measurement. 
(Hint : Construct PX such that length of PX = length of AB ; 

then cut off XQ such that XQ also has the length of AB .) 

5. Given AB of length 7.3 cm and CD of length 3.4 cm, construct 
a line segment XY such that the length of XY is equal to the difference between 
the lengths of AB and CD . Verify by measurement. 
14.3.2 Constructing a copy of a given line segment 
Suppose you want to draw a line segment whose length is equal to that of a 
given line segment AB . 

A quick and natural approach is to use your ruler (which is marked with 
centimetres and millimetres) to measure the length of AB and then use the 

same length to draw another line segment CD . 

A second approach would be to use a transparent sheet and trace AB onto 
another portion of the paper. But these methods may not always give accurate 
results. 

A better approach would be to use ruler and compasses for making this 
construction. 

To make a copy of AB . 

Step 1 Given AB whose length is not known. 

A B 
... 



|...........|. 


Step 2 Fix the compasses pointer on A and the pencil 
end on B. The opening of the instrument now 
gives the length of AB . 

Step 3 Draw any line l. Choose a point C 
onl. Without changing the compasses 
setting, place the pointer on C. 


Step 4 Swing an arc that cuts l at a point, say, D. Now CD is a copy of AB . 


EXERCISE 14.3 

1. Draw any line segment PQ . Without measuring PQ , construct a copy of PQ . 
2. Given some line segment AB , whose length you do not know, construct PQ 
such that the length of PQ is twice that of AB . 
14.4 Perpendiculars 
You know that two lines (or rays or segments) are said 
to be perpendicular if they intersect such that the angles 
formed between them are right angles. 

In the figure, the lines l and m are perpendicular. 

...

.......... 


The corners of a foolscap paper or your notebook 
indicate lines meeting at right angles. 

DoThis
Where else do you see 
perpendicular lines around you? 

Take a piece of paper. Fold it 
down the middle and make the 
crease. Fold the paper once again 
down the middle in the other direction. Make the crease and open out the 
page. The two creases are perpendicular to each other. 


14.4.1 Perpendicular to a line through a point on it 
Given a line l drawn on a paper sheet and a point P 
lying on the line. It is easy to have a perpendicular to l 
through P. 

We can simply fold the paper such that the lines on 
both sides of the fold overlap each other. 

Tracing paper or any transparent paper could be better 
for this activity. Let us take such a paper and draw any 
line l on it. Let us mark a point P anywhere on l. 


Fold the sheet such that l is reflected on itself; adjust the fold so that the 
crease passes through the marked point P. Open out; the crease is 
perpendicular to l. 

Think, discuss and write 

How would you check if it is perpendicular? Note that it passes through P as 

required. 
A challenge : Drawing perpendicular using ruler and a set-square (An optional 
activity). 

Step 1 A line l and a point P are given. Note that P is on the line l. 


Step 2 Place a ruler with one of its edges along l. Hold this firmly. 

... 




|...........|. 


Step 3 Place a set-square with one of its 
edges along the already aligned edge of the 
ruler such that the right angled corner is in 
contact with the ruler. 

Step 4 Slide the set-square along the edge of 
ruler until its right angled corner coincides 
with P. 


Step 5 Hold the set-square firmly in this 
position. Draw PQ along the edge of the 
set-square. 


PQ is perpendicular to l. (How do you use the 
.
symbol to say this?). 
Verify this by measuring the angle at P. 
Can we use another set-square in the place of the ‘ruler’? Think about it. 

Method of ruler and compasses 

As is the preferred practice in Geometry, the dropping of a perpendicular can 
be achieved through the “ruler-compasses” construction as follows : 

Step 1 Given a point P on a line l. 

...
Step 2 With P as centre and a convenient 
radius, construct an arc intersecting the line 
l at two points A and B. 

Step 3 With A and B as centres and a radius 
greater than AP construct two arcs, which 
cut each other at Q. 


.......... 


....

Step 4 Join PQ. Then PQ is perpendicular to l. 

.... 


We write PQ 
.
l. 


14.4.2Perpendicular to a line through a point not on it 
DoThis
(Paper folding) 

If we are given a line l and a point P not lying on it and 
we want to draw a perpendicular to l through P, we can 
again do it by a simple paper folding as before. 

Take a sheet of paper (preferably transparent). 
Draw any line l on it. 
Mark a point P away from l. 
Fold the sheet such that the crease passes through P. 


The parts of the line l on both sides of the fold should 
overlap each other. 
Open out. The crease is perpendicular to l and passes through P. 

Method using ruler and a set-square (An optional 

activity) 
Step 1 Let l be the given line and P be a point 
outside l. 

Step 2 Place a set-square on l such that one arm 
of its right angle aligns along l. 


Step 3 Place a ruler along the edge opposite to 
the right angle of the set-square. 

... 



|...........|. 


Step 4 Hold the ruler fixed. Slide the set-square 
along the ruler till the point P touches the other 
arm of the set-square. 

Step 5 Join PM along the edge through P, 
meeting l at M. 

.... 


Now PM 
.
l. 


Method using ruler and compasses 

A more convenient and accurate method, of course, is the ruler-compasses 
method. 


Step 1 Given a line l and a point P not on it. 


Step 2 With P as centre, draw an arc which 
intersects line l at two points A and B. 

Step 3 Using the same radius and with A and 
B as centres, construct two arcs that intersect 
at a point, say Q, on the other side. 

...

.......... 



....

Step 4 Join PQ. Thus, PQ is perpendicular to l. 


EXERCISE 14.4 

1. Draw any line segment AB . Mark any point M 
on it. Through M, draw a perpendicular to AB . 
(use ruler and compasses) 


2. Draw any line segment PQ . Take any point R not on it. Through R, draw a 
perpendicular to PQ . (use ruler and set-square) 

3. Draw a line l and a point X on it. Through X, draw a line segment XY perpendicular 
to l. 
Now draw a perpendicular to XY at Y. (use ruler and compasses) 

14.4.3 The perpendicular bisector of a line segment 
DoThis
Fold a sheet of paper. Let AB be the fold. Place 
an ink-dot X, as shown, anywhere. Find the 
image X' of X, with AB as the mirror line. 
Let AB and 
XX’ intersect 
at O. 
Is OX = OX'? Why? 
This means that AB divides XX’ into two 


parts of equal length. AB bisects XX’ or AB 
is a bisector of XX’. Note also that 
.
AOX and 
.
BOX are right angles. (Why?). 

Hence, AB is the perpendicular bisector of XX’. We see only a part of AB 
in the figure. Is the perpendicular bisector of a line joining two points the 
same as the axis of symmetry? 

DoThis
(Transparent tapes) 


Step 1 Draw a line segment AB . 

... 



|...........|. 



Step 2 Place a strip of a transparent 
rectangular tape diagonally across AB 
with the edges of the tape on the end 
points A and B, as shown in the figure. 

Step 3 Repeat the process by placing 
another tape over A and B just diagonally 
across the previous one. The two strips 
cross at M and N. 


Step 4 Join M and N. Is MN a bisector of 

AB ? Measure and verify. Is it also the 
perpendicular bisector of AB ? Where is 
the mid point of AB ? 

Construction using ruler and compasses 

Step 1 Draw a line segment AB of any length. 

Step 2 With A as centre, using compasses, 
draw a circle. The radius of your circle should 
be more than half the length of AB . 


Step 3 With the same radius and with B as centre, draw another circle using 
compasses. Let it cut the previous circle at C and D. 

...

.......... 



Step 4 Join CD . It cuts AB at O. Use your 

divider to verify that O is the midpoint of AB . 
Also verify that 
.
COA and 
.
COB are right 
angles. Therefore, CD is the perpendicular 
bisector of AB . 

In the above construction, we needed the 

O 
two points C and D to determine CD . Is it 
necessary to draw the whole circle to find them? 
Is it not enough if we draw merely small arcs to 
locate them? In fact, that is what we do in 
practice! 


EXERCISE 14.5 

1. Draw AB of length 7.3 cm and find its axis of symmetry. 
2. Draw a line segment of length 9.5 cm and construct its perpendicular bisector. 
3. Draw the perpendicular bisector of XY whose length is 10.3 cm. 
(a) Take any point P on the bisector drawn. Examine whether PX = PY. 
(b) If M is the mid point of XY , what can you say about the lengths MX and XY? 
4. Draw a line segment of length 12.8 cm. Using compasses, divide it into four 
equal parts. Verify by actual measurement. 
5. With PQ of length 6.1 cm as diameter, draw a circle. 
6. Draw a circle with centre C and radius 3.4 cm. Draw any chord AB . Construct 
the perpendicular bisector of AB and examine if it passes through C. 
7. Repeat Question 6, if AB happens to be a diameter. 
8. Draw a circle of radius 4 cm. Draw any two of its chords. Construct the 
perpendicular bisectors of these chords. Where do they meet? 
9. Draw any angle with vertex O. Take a point A on one of its arms and B on 
another such that OA = OB. Draw the perpendicular bisectors of OA and OB . 
Let them meet at P. Is PA = PB ? 

14.5 Angles 
14.5.1 Constructing an angle of a given measure 
Suppose we want an angle of measure 40°. 

... 


In Step 2 of the 
construction using ruler 
and compasses, what 
would happen if we take 
the length of radius to be 
smaller than half the 
length of AB ? 

|...........|. 


Here are the steps to follow : 
Step 1 Draw AB of any length. 


Step 2 Place the centre of the protractor at A and 
the zero edge along AB . 


Step 3 Start with zero near B. Mark point C at 40°. 


Step 4 Join AC. 
.
BAC is the required angle. 


14.5.2 Constructing a copy of an angle of unknown measure 
Suppose an angle (whose measure we do not know) 
is given and we want to make a copy of this angle. 
As usual, we will have to use only a straight edge 
and the compasses. 

Given 
.
A , whose measure is not known. 


Step 1 Draw a line l and choose a point P on it. 
Step 2 Place the compasses at A and draw an 

arc to cut the rays of 
.
A at B and C. 
Step 3 Use the same compasses setting to draw 

...

.......... 


an arc with P as centre, cutting l in Q. 

l 
Step 4 Set your compasses to the length BC with 
the same radius. 

Step 5 Place the compasses pointer at Q and draw 
the arc to cut the arc drawn earlier in R. 

Step 6 Join PR. This gives us 
.
P . It has the same 
measure as
.
A . 
This means 
.
QPR has same measure as 
.
BAC . 

14.5.3 Bisector of an angle 
T p per. Mark a point O DoThison it. With O as initial point, draw two 

........ 
rays OA and OB . You get 
.
AOB . 

Fold the sheet through O such that the 

........

rays OA and OB coincide. Let OC 
be the crease of paper which is 
obtained after unfolding the paper. 


OC is clearly a line of symmetry for 
.
AOB . 
Measure 
.
AOC and 
.
COB. Are they equal? OC the line of symmetry, is 
therefore known as the angle bisector of 
.
AOB . 

Construction with ruler and compasses 

Let an angle, say, 
.
A be given. 
Step 1 With A as centre and using compasses, draw an 

... 


arc that cuts both rays of 
.
A . Label the points 


l 

|...........|. 


of intersection as B and C. 


Step 2 With B as centre, draw (in the interior of 

.
A ) an arc whose radius is more than half 
the length BC. 

Step 3 With the same radius and with C as centre, 

draw another arc in the interior of 
.
A . Let 

the two arcs intersect at D. Then AD is the 
required bisector of 
.
A . 


14.5.4 Angles of special 
measures 
There are some elegant and accurate methods to 
construct some angles of special sizes which do not 
require the use of the protractor. We discuss a few here. 

Constructing a 60° angle 
Step 1 Draw a line l and mark a point O on it. 

In Step 2 above, 
what would 
happen if we 
take radius to 
be smaller than 
half the length 
BC? 
Step 2 Place the pointer of the compasses 
at O and draw an arc of convenient radius 

....

which cuts the line PQ at a point say, A. 

Step 3 With the pointer at A (as centre), 

...

.......... 


now draw an arc that passes through O. 


Step 4 Let the two arcs intersect at B. Join OB. 
We get 
.
BOA whose measure is 60°. 

Constructing a 30° angle 


Construct an angle of 60° as shown earlier. Now, bisect 

this angle. Each angle is 30°, verify by using a protractor. 

Constructing a 120° angle 

An angle of 120° is nothing but twice of an angle of 60°. 

How will you 
construct a 
15° angle? 
Therefore, it can be constructed as follows : 

Step 1 Draw any line PQ and take a point O 
on it. 
Step 2 Place the pointer of the compasses at 
O and draw an arc of convenient radius which cuts the line at A. 


Step 3 Without disturbing the radius on the 
compasses, draw an arc with A as centre which 

cuts the first arc at B. 

Step 4 Again without disturbing the radius on 
the compasses and with B as centre, draw an 
arc which cuts the first arc at C. 


... 



|...........|. 


Step 5 Join OC, 
.
COA is the required angle whose 
measure is 120°. 


How will you 
construct a 
150° angle? 
Constructing a 90° angle 

Construct a perpendicular to a line from a point lying on it, 
as discussed earlier. This is the required 90° angle. 

How will you 
construct a 
45° angle? 
EXERCISE 14.6 

1. Draw 
.
POQ of measure 75° and find its line of symmetry. 
2. Draw an angle of measure 147° and construct its bisector. 
3. Draw a right angle and construct its bisector. 
4. Draw an angle of measure 153° and divide it into four equal parts. 
5. Construct with ruler and compasses, angles of following measures: 
(a) 60° (b) 30° (c) 90° (d) 120° (e) 45° (f) 135° 
6. Draw an angle of measure 45° and bisect it. 
7. Draw an angle of measure 135° and bisect it. 
8. Draw an angle of 70o. Make a copy of it using only a straight edge and compasses. 
9. Draw an angle of 40o. Copy its supplementary angle.

(i) A graduated ruler (ii) The compasses 
(iii) The divider (iv) Set-squares (v) The protractor 
2. Using the ruler and compasses, the following constructions can be made:
