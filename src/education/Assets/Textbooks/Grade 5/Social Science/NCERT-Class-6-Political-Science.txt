Understanding 
Diversity 

Look around you in the classroom: do you see 
anyone who looks exactly like you do? In this 
chapter you will learn that people are different from 
each other in many ways. Not only do they look 
different but they might also belong to different 
regional, cultural or religious backgrounds. These 
differences enrich our lives in many ways and also 
make them more fun! 

All these different people, who come from all kinds of 
backgrounds, and belong to all kinds of religions and 
cultures help to make India so interesting and so 
diverse. What does diversity add to our lives? How 
did India become like this? Are all kinds of difference 
a part of diversity? Can diversity also be a part of 
unity? Read this chapter to find some answers.

hree children around your age have drawn 
the figures above. Use the empty box to 
draw your human figure. Is your drawing 
similar to any of the others? The chances are 
that your drawing is quite different from the 
other three, which you can see are quite 
different from each other. This is because each 
one of us has a unique drawing style. We not 
only don't look exactly like each other but also 
differ in terms of the language we speak, our 
cultural backgrounds, the religious rituals we 
observe and, of course the way we draw!

Now ask your teacher to help you 
check, how many of you have similar 
answers. Is there anyone whose list 
matches yours exactly? Probably not. 
But many of you may have similar 
answers. How many like reading the 
same kind of books? How many 
different languages are spoken by the 
students in your class? 

By now you must have recognised 
the many ways in which you are quite 
like some of your classmates and 
other ways in which you are different 
from them. 

Making friends 

Do you think it would be easy for you 
to make friends with someone who 
was very different from you? Read the 
following story and think about this. 

I had meant it as a joke. A joke 
made up for a small ragged boy who 
sold newspapers at the Janpat 
crossing at the busy intersection. 
Every time I cycled past he would run 
after me, holding out the English paper 

and screaming out the evening's 
headlines in a mixture of Hindi and 
English words. This time, I stopped by 
the pavement and asked for the Hindi 
paper. His mouth fell open. 

"You mean you know Hindi?" he 
asked. 

"Of course," I said as I paid for the 
paper. 

"Why? What did you think?" 

He paused. "But you look so…so 
angrez," he said. "You mean you can 
even read Hindi?" 

"Of course I can," I said, this time a 
little impatiently. "I can speak, read 


and write Hindi. Hindi is one of the 
subjects I study in school." 

"Subjects?" he asked. How could I 
explain what a subject was to someone 
who had never been to school? "Well, it 
is something…" I began, but the lights 
changed, and the honking behind me 
grew a hundredfold and I let myself be 
pushed along with the rest of the 
traffic. 



The next day he was there again, 
smiling at me and holding out a Hindi 
paper. "Bhaiyya," he said, "aap ka 
akhbaar. Ab Bathaaiye yeh subject 
kya cheez hai?" the English word 
sounded strange on his tongue. 
It sounded like its other meaning 
in English – to be ruled by someone 
else. 

"Oh, it's just something to study," I 
said. And then because the red light 
had come on, I asked him, "Have you 
ever been to school?" "Never," he 
answered. And he added proudly, "I 
began working when I was so high." 
He measured himself against my 
cycle-seat. "First my mother used to 
come with me but I can do it all alone." 

"Where is your mother now?" I 
asked, but then the lights changed and 
I was off. I heard him yell from 
somewhere behind me, "She's in 
Meerut with…" The rest was drowned 
out. 

"My name is Samir," he said the 
next day. And very shyly he asked, 
"What's yours?" It was incredible. My 
bicycle wobbled. "My name is Samir 
too," I said. "What?" His eyes lit up. 
"Yes," I grinned at him. "It's another 
name for Hanuman's father, you 
know." "So now you are Samir Ek and 
I'm Samir Do," he said triumphantly. 
"Something like that," I answered and 
then I held out my hand. "Haath milao, 
Samir Do!" His hand nestled in mine 
like a little bird. I could still feel its 
warmth as I cycled away. 

Understanding Diversity / 5 

The next day, he did not have his 
usual smile for me. "There is trouble in 
Meerut," he said. "Many people are 
being killed there in the riots." I looked 
at the headlines. Communal Riots, it 
blazed. "But Samir…" I began. "I'm a 
Muslim Samir," he said in answer. 
"And all my people are in Meerut." His 
eyes filled with tears and when I 
touched his shoulder, he would not 
look up. 

He was not at the crossing the day 
after. Neither the day after nor ever 
again. And no newspaper, in English or 
Hindi, can tell me where my Samir do 
has gone. 

(The Lights Changed by Poile Sengupta) 

Name three ways in which Samir 
Ek and Samir Do were different? 
Did these differences prevent 
them from becoming friends? 
While Samir Ek is more familiar 
with English, Samir Do speaks Hindi. 
Although they both are more at home 
in different languages they still 
communicated with each other. They 
made the effort to do so because this 
was what was important to them. 

Samir Ek and Samir Do also come 
from different religious and cultural 
backgrounds. While Samir Ek is a 
Hindu, Samir Do is a Muslim. 
Different religious and cultural 
backgrounds such as these are an 
aspect of diversity. 



6/ Social and Political Life 

Make a list of the festivals that 
might have been celebrated by 
the two boys. 
Samir Ek: 
Samir Do: 
Can you think of a situation in 
which you made friends with 
someone who was very different 
from you? Write a story that 
describes this. 
In addition to their 
diverse religious and 
cultural backgrounds, 
there are other ways 
in which Samir Ek 
and Samir Do are 
different from each 
other. For example, 
while Samir Ek goes to 
school, Samir Do sells 
newspapers. 

Discuss 

Why do you think Samir Do did 
not attend school? Do you think 
it would have been easy for him 
to attend school if he wanted to? 
In your opinion is it a fair 
situation that some children get 
to go to school and others don't? 

Samir Do did not have the 
opportunity to attend school. Perhaps 
you've noticed that there are several 
people in the area where you live who 
are poor and who don't have enough 
to eat or wear and sometimes not even 
a place to live. This difference is not 
the same as the one we have seen 

earlier. Here, we're talking not of 
difference but of inequality. Inequality 
comes about when a person does not 
have the resources and opportunitites 
that are available to other persons. 

The caste system is another 
example of inequality. According to 
this, society was divided into different 
groups depending upon the work that 
people did and they were supposed to 
remain in those groups. So if your 
parents were potters you could only 
become a potter, nothing else. This 
system was considered irreversible. 
And because you were not supposed 
to change your profession, it was not 
considered necessary for you to know 
anything more than what you needed 
in your profession. This created a 
situation of inequality. You will read 
more about this and other inequalities 
in the following chapters. 

What does diversity add to our 
lives? 

Just like Samir Ek and Samir Do 
became friends, you might have 
friends who are very different from 
you. You have probably eaten 
different kinds of food in their homes, 
celebrated different festivals with 
them, tried out the clothes they wear, 
and learnt some of their languages 
as well. 

Make a list of the food that you 
have eaten from different parts of 
India. 
Make a list of the languages besides 
your mother tongue that you can 
speak at least one or two words of. 

You probably like reading and 
hearing stories and adventures about 
different animals, people and even 
ghosts. Perhaps you even enjoy 
making up stories yourself ! Many 
young people feel happy when they 
read a good story because it gives 
them lots of ideas to make up more 
stories. People who write stories get 
their ideas from all sorts of different 
places – from books, and real life and 
from their imagination. 

Some may have lived in forests 
close to animals and chosen to write 
of their fights and friendships. Others 
read real accounts of kings and 
queens and wrote stories about love 
and honour. Some dipped into their 
own childhood memories of school 
and friends and wrote stories of 
adventure.

far were forced to live in a 
place where all people wore 
the same two colours red and 
white, ate the same food 
(maybe potatoes!), took care 
of the same two animals, 
for example, the deer and 
the cat, and to entertain 
themselves played snakes 
and ladders. What kind of 
stories do you think they 
would write?

an artist who lives in the place 
described above. Either write a 
story or draw a picture of your 
life here. 
Do you think you would enjoy 
living in a place like this? List five 
different things that you would 
miss the most if you lived here. 
DIVERSITY IN INDIA 

India is a country of many diversities. 
We speak different lang-uages, have 
various types of food, celebrate 
different festivals, practise different 
religions. But actually, if you think 
about it, we do many things that are 
similar except that we do them in 
different ways. 

How do we explain Diversity? 

A little more than two hundred years 
ago or long before the train, 
aeroplane, bus or car became a part of 
our lives, people travelled from one 
part of the world to another, in ships, 
on horses or camels or on foot. 



8/ Social and Political Life 

List at least three different ways in which people in India do the following. 
One of the possible answers has been provided for you already. 

Different ways in Through singing a 

which people pray hymn 

Different ways in 
which people get 
married 

Different ways in 
which people dress 

Different ways in 
which people greet 
each other 

Different ways in By making Biriyani 
which people cook with meat or 
rice vegetables 

Often, they went in search of new 
lands, or new places to settle in, or for 
people to trade with. And because it 
took so long to travel, once they got to 
a place, people stayed there, often for 
a long time. Many others left their 
homes because there were famines 
and drought and they could not get 
enough to eat. Some went in search of 
work while others left because there 
was a war. 

Sometimes, as they began to make 
their homes in new places, people 
began to change a little and at other 
times they managed to do things in 
the old ways. So their languages, food, 

Through signing a

music, religions became a mix of the 
old and the new, and out of this intermixing 
of cultures, came something 
new and different. 

The history of many places shows 
us how many different cultural 
influences have helped to shape life 
and culture there. Thus regions 
became very diverse because of their 
unique histories. 

Similarly diversity also comes 
about when people adapt their lives to 
the geographical area in which they 
live. For example living near the sea is 
quite different from living in a 
mountainous area.

Buddhism reached Tibet via Ladakh. Ladakh is 
also called Little Tibet. Islam was introduced in 
this region more than four hundred years ago 
and there is a significant Muslim population 
here. Ladakh has a very rich oral tradition of 
songs and poems. Local versions of the Tibetan 
national epic the Kesar Saga are performed and 
sung by both Muslims and Buddhists.

Kerala is a state in the south-
west corner of India. It is 
surrounded by the sea on one 
side and hills on the other. A 
number of spices like pepper, 
cloves and cardamoms are grown on the 
hills. It is spices that made this region 
an attractive place for traders. Jewish 
and Arab traders were the first to come 
here. The Apostle of Christ, St. Thomas 
is believed to have come here nearly 
2000 years ago and he is credited with 
bringing Christianity to India. 
Many Arab traders also came and 
settled down here. Ibn Battuta, who 
travelled here a little less than seven 
hundred years ago, wrote a travelogue in 
which he describes the lives of Muslims 
and says that they were a 
highly respected community. The 
Portuguese discovered the sea 
route to India from Europe when 
Vasco da Gama landed with his 
ship here. 
Because of all these various 
historical influences, people in 
Kerala practise different religions 
such as Judaism, Islam, Chris-
tianity, Hinduism and Buddhism. 
The fishing nets used here look 
exactly like the Chinese fishing 
nets and are called cheena-vala. 
Even the utensil used for frying is called 
the cheenachatti, and it is believed that 
the word cheen could have come from 
China. The fertile land and climate are 
suited to growing rice and a majority of 
people here eat rice, fish and 
vegetables. 
The boat race is an important part of 
the Onam festival celebrated in Kerala. 

While Kerala and Ladakh are quite 
different in terms of their 
geographical features, the history of 
both regions has seen similar cultural 
influences. Both regions were 
influenced by Chinese and Arab 
traders. It was the geography of 
Kerala which allowed for the 
cultivation of spices and the special 
geographical location of Ladakh and 
its wool that drew traders to these 
regions. Thus history and geography 
are often tied in the cultural life of a 
region. 

The influence of diverse cultures is 
not merely a thing of the past. Our 
present lives are all about moving 
from place to place for work and with 
each move our cultural traditions and 
way of life slowly becomes part of the 
new place we are in. Similarly in our 
own neighbourhoods we live close to 
people from several communities. Our 
daily lives are about the ways in 
which we do things together and hear 
stories about each other's lives, 
customs and traditions. 

UNITY IN DIVERSITY 

India's diversity has always been 
recognised as a source of its strength. 
When the British ruled India, women 
and men from different cultural, 
religious and regional backgrounds 
came together to oppose them. India's 
freedom movement had thousands of 
people of different backgrounds in it. 
They worked together to decide joint 
actions, they went to jail together, and 
they found different ways to oppose 
the British. Interestingly the British 

Understanding Diversity / 11 
thought they could divide Indians 
because they were so different, and 
then continue to rule them. But the 
people showed how they could be 
different and yet be united in their 
battle against the British. 

Don't forget the days of blood, O friend

to shed a tear for us

flower

Do light a lamp on this lonely grave 
O friend 
The blood of Hindus and Muslims flows 

together today 

Do soak your robe in this river of blood

graves 
Do shed a few tears for them O friend. 

Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA) 

This song was sung after the 
Jallianwalla Bagh massacre in 
Amritsar in which a British general 
opened fire on a large group of 
unarmed, peaceful people killing 
many and wounding even more. Men 
and women, Hindus, Sikhs and 
Muslims, rich and poor had gathered 
to protest against the British. This 
song was composed and sung 
to honour the memory of those 
brave people. 



Pt. Nehru delivering an Independence Day speech

In his book The 
Discovery of India 

Jawaharlal Nehru says 

that Indian unity is not 

something imposed 

from the outside but 

rather, "It was 

something deeper and 

within its fold, the 

widest tolerance of 

belief and custom was 

practised and every 

variety acknowledged 

and even encouraged." 

It was Nehru, who 

coined the phrase, "unity in diversity"

Songs and symbols that emerged 

to describe the country.
during the freedom struggle serve as a 
constant reminder of our country's 
rich tradition of respect for diversity. 
Do you know the story of the Indian 
flag? It was used as a symbol of 
protest against the British by people 
everywhere. 

India's national anthem, 
composed by Rabindranath 
Tagore, is another expression 
of the unity of India. In what 
way does the national 
anthem describe this unity? 
QUESTIONS 

1. Draw up a list of the different festivals celebrated in your locality. 
Which of these celebrations are shared by members of different 
regional and religious communities? 
2. What do you think living in India with its rich heritage of diversity 
adds to your life? 
3. Do you think the term "unity in diversity" is an appropriate term to 
describe India? What do you think Nehru is trying to say about 
Indian unity in the sentence quoted above from his book The 
Discovery of India? 
4. Underline the line in the poem sung after the Jallianwalla massacre, 
which according to you, reflects India's essential unity. 
5. Choose another region in India and do a similar study of the 
historical and geographical factors that influence the diversity found 
there. Are these historical and geographical factors connected to 
each other? How? 

Chapter 2 

Diversity and 
Discrimination 

In the previous chapter you have discussed the 
meanings of diversity. Sometimes people who are 
'different' from others are teased, laughed at or not 
included in a certain activity or group. We feel 
hurt, angry, helpless or sad when friends or others 
treat us in such ways. Have you ever wondered 
why this happens? 

In this chapter we will try and explore how such 
experiences are related to the society we live in. 
We will look at how they are connected to the 
inequalities that exist around us. 


Difference and Prejudice 

here are many things that make T us what we are – how we live, the 

languages we speak, what we eat, 
wear, the games we play and the 
things we celebrate. All of these are 
influenced both by the geography and 
history of the place where we live. 

You will get an idea of how diverse 
India is if you look even briefly at the 
following statement: 

There are eight major religions in the 
world. Every single one of them is 
practised in India. We have more than 

1600 languages that are people's 
mother tongues, and there are more 
than a hundred dance forms. 

Yet this diversity is not always 
celebrated. We feel safe and secure 
with people who look, talk, dress and 
think like us. 

Sometimes when we meet people 
who are very different from us we may 
find them strange and unfamiliar. At 
times we may not understand or know 
the reasons why they are different 
from us. People also form certain 
attitudes and opinions about others 
who are not like them. 



14 / Social and Political Life 

Below are some statements on 
people living in rural and urban areas. 
Tick mark those that you agree with: 

On Rural People 
More than 50% of all Indians 
live in villages. 
Villagers do not care about 
their health. They are full of 
superstition. 
People in villages are backward 
and lazy. They do not like to 
work. 
In peak harvesting and planta-
tion season, families spend 12 
to 14 hours working in the 
fields. 
Villagers are dirty and not 
hygienic. 
On Urban People 
Life in the city is easy. People 
here are spoilt and lazy. 
In cities families spend very 
little time with each other. 
People in towns only care about 
money, not about people. 
Living in a city is expensive. A 
large part of people's earnings 
is spent on rent and transport. 
City people cannot be trusted, 
they are cunning and corrupt. 
Some of the statements above see 
villagers as dirty, ignorant and 
superstitious, and see people in cities 
as money-minded, lazy and cunning. 

When our opinions about certain 
people are always negative – seeing 
them as lazy, cunning, stingy – as 
some of the statements above, then 
these become prejudices that we carry 
about them. 

Prejudice means to judge other 
people negatively or see them as 
inferior. When we think that only one 
particular way is the best and right 
way to do things we often end up not 
respecting others, who may prefer to 
do things differently. For example if 
we think English is the best language 
and other languages are not 
important, we are judging these other 
languages negatively. As a result, we 
might not respect people who speak 
languages other than English. 

We can be prejudiced about many 
things: people's religious beliefs, the 
colour of their skin, the region they 
come from, the accent they speak in, 
the clothes they wear etc. Often, our 
prejudices about others are so strong 
that we don't want to form friendships 
with them. At times, we may even act 
in ways that hurt them. 

Look again at the statements that you 
believed to be true about rural and 
urban life in India. Do you have a 
prejudice against rural or urban 
people? Find out if this is shared by 
others and discuss the reasons why 
people have these prejudices. 

Can you list some of the prejudices 
that you have noticed around you. 
How do they affect the ways in which 
people treat each other? 



Diversity and Discrimination / 15 

Creating Stereotypes 

All of us are familiar with gender 
differences. What does it mean to be a 
boy or a girl? Many of you would say, 
"We are born as boys and girls. It is a 
given. What is there to think about?" 
Let's see if this is the case. 

Arrange the statements given below in 
these two sections, according to what 
you think is appropriate for the section. 
They are well behaved. 
They are soft spoken and gentle. 
They are physically strong . 
They are naughty. 
They are good at dance and painting. 
They don't cry. 
They are rowdy. 
They are good at sport. 
They are good at cooking. 
They are emotional.

Now check, with your teacher's help, who has put which statement 
where. Find out and discuss people's reasons for doing this. Are the 
qualities you put in for boys something that boys are born with? 
If we take the statement ''They 
don't cry", you'll see that this is a 
quality that is generally associated 
with boys and men. As babies or 
children when boys fall and hurt 
themselves, their parents and other 
family members often console them by 
saying "Don't cry. You are a boy. Boys 

are brave, they don't cry." As children 
grow up they start believing that boys 
do not cry so that even if a boy feels 
like crying he stops himself from 
doing so. He also believes that crying 
is a sign of weakness. So, even though 
both boys and girls sometimes want to 
cry, especially if they are angry or in

pain, as they grow older boys learn or 
teach themselves not to cry. If a 
grown boy cries, then he feels that 
others will either tease him or laugh 
at him, and so he stops himself from 
doing so in front of others. 

This is the way boys are and this is 
how girls are: these are statements we 
hear constantly and accept without 
even thinking, and we start believing 
that each one of us must behave 
accordingly. We fit all boys and all 
girls into an image that society creates 
around us. 

You can take other statements such 
as They are soft and gentle or 
They are well behaved and discuss 
how these are applied to girls. Do 
girls possess these qualities at birth 
or do they learn such behaviour 
from others? What do you think 
about girls who are not soft and 
gentle and those who are naughty? 
When we fix people into one image 
we create a stereotype. When people 
say that those who belong to a 
particular country, religion, sex, race 
or economic background are "stingy" 
"lazy," "criminal" or "dumb," they are 
using stereotypes. There are stingy 
and generous people everywhere, in 
every country, in every religion, in 
every group whether rich or poor, 
male or female. And just because 
some people are like that it is not fair 
to think that everyone will be the 
same. 

Stereotypes stop us from looking at 
each person as a unique individual 
with his or her own special qualities 
and skills that are different from

others. They fit large numbers of 
people into only one pattern or type. 
Stereotypes affect all of us as they 
prevent us from doing certain things, 
that we might otherwise be good at. 

Inequality and Discrimination 

Discrimination happens when people 
act on their prejudices or stereotypes. 
If you do something to put other 
people down, if you stop them from 
taking part in certain activities and 
taking up jobs, or stop them from 
living in certain neighbour-hoods, 
prevent them from taking water from 
the same well or hand pump, or not 
allow them to drink tea in the same 
cups or glasses as others, you are 
discriminating against them. 

Discrimination can take place 
because of several reasons. You 
probably recall from the previous 
chapter that Samir Ek and Samir Do 
were different from each other in 
many ways. For example, they 
belonged to different religions. This is 
an aspect of diversity. However, this 
diversity can also be a source of 
discrimination. Groups of people who 
may speak a certain language, follow 
a particular religion, live in specific 
regions etc., may be discriminated 
against as their customs or practices 
may be seen as inferior. 

Another difference between the two 
Samirs was in their economic 
backgrounds. Samir Do was poor. 
This difference, as you have read 
earlier, is not a form of diversity but of 
inequality. People who are poor do 
not have the resources or the money

A common stereotype about Muslims is 
that they are not interested in 
educating girls and therefore do not 
send girls to school. However, studies 
have now shown that poverty amongst 
Muslims is an important reason why 
Muslim girls do not attend school or 
leave school after a few years. 
Wherever, effort has been made to 
reach education to the poor, there the 
Muslim community has shown an 
interest in sending their girls to school. 
For example in the state of Kerala the 
distance between the school and the 
home is not much. There is a good 
government bus service that helps 
teachers reach schools in rural areas 
and over sixty per cent of the teachers 
are women. These factors have helped 
children from poorer families, 
including Muslim girls, attend school 
in much larger numbers. 
In other states, where such efforts have 
not been made children from poorer 
families whether Muslim, tribal or so-
called lower castes find it difficult to 
attend school. Therefore, poverty not 
religion is the cause for non-attendance 
of Muslim girls in school. 
to meet their basic needs 

of food, clothing and 

shelter. They experience 

discrimination in offices, in 

hospitals, schools etc., 

where they are treated 

badly because they are 

poor. 

Some people may 

experience both kinds of dis


crimination. They are poor 

and they belong to groups 

whose culture is not valued. 

Tribals, some religious 

groups and even particular 

regions, are discriminated 
against for one or more of these 
reasons. In the following section we will 
look at how a famous Indian was 
discriminated against. This will help us 
understand the ways in which caste 
was used to discriminate against large 
numbers of people. 

On being discriminated against 

People are engaged in different kinds 
of work like teaching, carpentry, 
pottery, weaving, fishing, farming etc. 
to earn a livelihood. However, certain 
kinds of work are valued more than 
others. Activities like cleaning, washing, 
cutting hair, picking garbage, are 
seen as tasks that are of less value 
and people who do this work are seen 
as dirty or impure. This belief is an 
important aspect of the caste system. 
In the caste system, communities/ 
groups of people were placed in a sort 
of ladder where each caste was either 
above or below the other. Those who 
placed themselves at the top of 
this ladder called themselves upper 



Dalit is a term that 
people belonging to so-
called lower castes use 
to address themselves. 
They prefer this word 
to 'untouchable'. Dalit 
means those who have 
been 'broken'. This 
word according to 
Dalits shows how 
social prejudices and 
discrimination have 
'broken' the Dalit 
people. The govern-
ment refers to this 
group of people as 
Scheduled Castes (SC).

caste and saw 
themselves as 
superior. The 
groups who 
were placed 
at the bottom 
of the ladder 
were seen as 
unworthy and 
called "untouchables". 


Caste rules 
were set which 
did not allow 
the so-called 
"untouchable" 
to take on work, other than what they 
were meant to do. For example, some 
groups were only allowed to pick 
garbage and remove dead animals 
from the village. But they were not 
allowed to enter the homes of the 
upper castes or take water from the 
village well, or even enter temples. 
Their children could not sit next to 
children of other castes in school. 

Being made to sit seperately in the classroom 
because of one's background is a form of 
discrimination. 

Diversity and Discrimination / 19 

What is the difference between 
discrimination and stereotypes? 
How do you think a person who is 
discriminated against might feel? 
Thus upper castes acted in ways, 
which did not give the so-called 
"untouchables" the same rights as 
they enjoyed. 

Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar, one of the 
great leaders of India, shares his first 
experience of caste-based discrimination, 
which took place in 1901 
when he was just nine years old. He 
had gone with his brothers and 
cousins to meet his father in Koregaon 
which is now in Maharashtra. 

Long did we wait, but no one turned 
up. An hour elapsed and the stationmaster 
came to enquire. He asked us 
for our tickets. We showed them to him. 
He asked us why we tarried. We told 
him that we were bound for Koregaon 
and that we were waiting for father or 
his servant to come, but that neither 
had turned up and that we did not 
know how to reach Koregaon. 

We were well-dressed children. 
From our dress or talk no one could 
make out that we were children of the 
untouchables. Indeed the stationmaster 
was quite sure we were 
Brahmin children and was extremely 
touched at the plight in which he found 
us. As is usual among the Hindus, the 
stationmaster asked us who we were. 
Without a moment's thought I blurted 
out that we were Mahars. (Mahar is 
one of the communities which are 
treated as untouchables in the Bombay

Presidency.) He was stunned. His face 
underwent a sudden change. We could 
see that he was overpowered by a 
strange feeling of repulsion. As soon as 
he heard my reply, he went away to his 
room and we stood where we were. 
Fifteen to twenty minutes elapsed; the 
sun was almost setting. Our father had 
not turned up nor had he sent his 
servant, and now the stationmaster had 
also left us. We were quite bewildered, 
and the joy and happiness, which we felt 
at the beginning of the journey, gave way 
to a feeling of extreme sadness. 

After half an hour the stationmaster 
returned and asked us what we proposed 
to do. We said that if we could get a 
bullock-cart on hire we would go to 
Koregaon, and if it was not very far we 
would like to start straightway. There 
were many bullock-carts plying for hire. 
But my reply to the station master that we 
were Mahars had gone round among the 
cart men and not one of them was 
prepared to suffer being polluted and to 
demean himself carrying passengers of 
the untouchable classes. We were 
prepared to pay double the fare but we 
found that money did not work. The 

Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar (1891-1956) 
is considered the father of the 
Indian Constitution and is also the 
best known leader of the Dalits. 
Dr Ambedkar fought for the rights 
of the Dalit community. He was 
born into the Mahar caste, which 
was considered untouchable. The 
Mahars were poor, owned no land 
and children born to them also had 
to do the work their parents did. 
They lived in spaces outside the 
main village and were not allowed 
into the village. 
Dr Ambedkar was the first person 
from his caste who completed his 
college education and went to 
England to become a lawyer. He 
encouraged Dalits to send their 
children to school and college. He 
also urged Dalits to take on different 
kinds of government jobs in order to 
move out of the caste system. He led 
many efforts of Dalits to gain entry 
into temples. Later in life he 
converted to Buddhism in his search 
for a religion that treated 
all members equally. 
Dr Ambedkar believed 
that Dalits must 
fight the caste 
system and work 
towards a society 
based on respect not 
just for a few but for 
all persons.

Despite the children 
offering money the cartmen 
refused them. Why? 
How did people at 
the station discriminate 
against Dr Ambedkar and 
his brothers? 
How do you think 
Dr Ambedkar felt as a 
child, when he saw the 
stationmaster's reaction to 
his statement that they 
were Mahars? 
Have you ever experienced 
prejudice or witnessed an 
incident of discrimination? 
How did this make you feel?

Imagine how difficult it would be if 
people could not move easily from one 
place to the other, how insulting and 
hurtful it is to have people move away, 
refuse to touch you or allow you to 
drink water from the same source as 
they do. 

This small incident shows how a 
simple task of going from one place to 
another in a cart was not available to 
the children – even though they could 
pay the money. All the cart men at the 
station refused to take the children. 
They acted in a discriminatory 
manner. 

So, clearly, as this story shows us, 
caste based discrimination is not only 
limited to preventing Dalits from 
undertaking certain economic 
activities but it also denies them the 
respect and dignity given to others. 

Diversity and Discrimination / 21 

Discuss 

In addition to the lower castes 
being discriminated against, there 
are also various other communities 
that are subject to discrimination. 

Can you think of a few other 
examples of discrimination. 

Discuss the ways in which persons 
with special needs might be 
subject to discrimination. 

Striving for Equality 

The struggle for freedom from British 
rule also included within it the 
struggle of large groups of people who 
not only fought against the British but 
also fought to be treated more equally. 
Dalits, women, tribals and peasants 
fought against the inequalities they 
experienced in their lives. 

As pointed out earlier, many Dalits 
organised themselves to gain entry 
into temples. Women demanded that 
they should have as much a right to 
education as men did. Peasants and 
tribals fought to release themselves 
from the grasp of the moneylender 
and the high interest they were 
charged. 

When India became a nation in 
1947 our leaders too were concerned 
about the different kinds of 
inequalities that existed. Those who 
wrote the Constitution of India, a 
document that laid out the rules by 
which the nation would function, 
were aware of the ways in which 



22 / Social and Political Life 

Women at a rally demanding their rights 


discrimination had been practised 

in our society and how people 
had struggled against this. Many 
leaders of these struggles such as 
Dr Ambedkar had also fought for the 
rights of the Dalits. 

So these leaders set out a vision 
and goals in the Constitution to 
ensure that all the people of India 
were considered equal. This equality 
of all persons is seen as a key value 
that unites us all as Indians. 
Everyone has equal rights and 
opportunities. Untouchability is seen 

as a crime and has been legally 
abolished by law. People are free 
to choose the kind of work they 
wish to do. Government jobs 
are open to all people. In addition, 
the Constitution also placed 
responsibility on the government 
to take specific steps to realise this 
right to equality for poor and other 
such marginal communities. 

The writers of the Constitution 
also said that respect for diversity 
was a significant element in 
ensuring equality. They felt that 
people must have the freedom to 
follow their religion, speak their 
language, celebrate their festivals 
and express themselves freely. 
They said that no one language, 
religion or festival should become 
compulsory for all to follow. They 
said that the government must 
treat all religions equally. 

Therefore, India became a 

secular country where people of 

different religions and faiths have

Constitution of India. 



Diversity and Discrimination / 23 
the freedom to practise and follow 
their religion without any fear of 
discrimination. This is seen as an 
important element of our unity – that 
we all live together and respect one 
other. 

Though these ideals are enshrined 
in our Constitution, this chapter 
points out that inequalities exist even 
today. Equality is a value that we 
have to keep striving for and not 
something which will happen 
automatically. People's struggles and 
positive actions by the government 
are necessary to make this a reality 
for all Indians. 

QUESTIONS

2. How can the stereotype that girls are a burden on their parents affect 
the life of a daughter? Imagine this situation and list at least five 
different effects that this stereotype can have on the way daughters 
get treated in the house. 
3. What does the Constitution say with regard to equality? Why do you 
think it is important for all people to be equal? 
4. Sometimes people make prejudiced comments in our presence. We are 
often not in a position to do anything about this because it is difficult 
to say something right then and there. Divide the class into groups 
and each group discuss what they could do in one of the following 
situations: 
a. A friend begins to tease a classmate because he is poor. 
b. You are watching TV with your family and one of them 
makes a prejudicial comment about a particular 
religious community. 
c. Children in your class refuse to share their food with a 
particular person because they think she is dirty. 
d. Someone tells you a joke that makes fun of a community 
because of their accent. 
e. Some boys make remarks about girls not being able to 
play games as well as them. 
Discuss in class what the different groups have suggested for the 
above situations, and also talk about the problems that can come up 
when raising the issue.

very country needs a government 
to make decisions and get things 
done. These can be decisions about 
where to build roads and schools, or 
how to reduce the price of onions 
when they get too expensive or ways 
to increase the supply of electricity. 
The government also takes action on 
many social issues, for example it has 
several programmes to help the poor. 
It does other important things such as 
running postal and railway services. 



28 / Social and Political Life 

The government also has the job of 
protecting the boundaries of the 
country and maintaining peaceful 
relations with other countries. It is 
responsible for ensuring that all its 
citizens have enough to eat and have 
good health facilities. When there are 
natural disasters like the tsunami or 
an earthquake it is the government 
that mainly organises aid and 
assistance for the affected people. If 
there is a dispute or if someone has 
committed a crime you find people in 
a court. Courts are also part of the 
government. 

Perhaps you are wondering how 
governments manage to do all this. 
And why it is necessary for them to do 
so. When human beings live and work 
together, there needs to be some 
amount of organisation so that 
decisions can be made. 

Can you list three things that 
the government does which 
have not been mentioned. 

1. 
2. 
3. 

Some rules have to be made that 
apply to everyone. For example, there 
is a need to control resources and 
protect the territory of a country, so 
people can feel secure. Governments 
do this on behalf of their people by 
exercising leadership, taking 
decisions and implementing these 
among all the people living in their 
territory. 

Levels of Government 

Now that you know that the 
government is responsible for so

and Bharat Petroleum. 



many different things, can you think 
of how it manages to do all this? The 
government works at different levels: 
at the local level, at the level of the 
state and at the national level. The 
local level means in your village, town 
or locality, the state level would mean 
that which covers an entire state like

how local level government functions,

Laws and the Government 

The government makes laws and 
everyone who lives in the country has 
to follow these. This is the only way 
governments can function. Just like 
the government has the power to 
make decisions, similarly it has the 
power to enforce its decisions. For 
example, there is a law that says that 
all persons driving a motor vehicle 
must have a license. Any person 
caught driving a vehicle without a 
license can either be jailed or fined a 
large sum of money. Without these 
laws the government's power to make 
decisions is not of much use. 

Discuss 

Think of an example of another 
law. Why do you think it is 
important that people abide by 
this law? 

In addition to any actions that 
governments can take, there are also 
steps that people can take if they feel 
that a particular law is not being 
followed. If a person feels, for 
example, that they were not hired for 
a job because of their religion or caste, 
he or she may approach the court and 
claim that the law is not being 
followed. The court can then give 
orders about what should be done. 

Types of Government 

Who gives the government this power 
to make decisions and enforce laws? 

The answer to this question 
depends on the type of government 
there is in a country. In a democracy 

What is Government? / 31 
it is the people who give the 
government this power. They do this 
through elections in which they vote 
for particular persons and elect them. 
Once elected, these persons form the 
government. In a democracy the 
government has to explain its actions 
and defend its decisions to the people. 

Another form of government is a 
monarchy. The monarch (king or 
queen) has the power to make 
decisions and run the government. 
The monarch may have a small group 
of people to discuss matters with but 
the final decision-making power 
remains with the monarch. Unlike in 
a democracy, kings and queens do not 
have to explain their actions or defend 
the decisions they take.

Democratic Governments 

India is a democracy. This 
achievement is the result of a long 
and eventful struggle of the Indian 
people. There are other places in the 
world where people have also 
struggled to have democracies. You 
now know that the main feature of a 
democracy is that the people have the 
power to elect their leaders. So in a 
sense a democracy is rule by the 
people. The basic idea is that people 
rule themselves by participating in the 
making of these rules. 

Democratic governments in our 
times are usually reffered to as 
representative democracies. In 
representative democracies people 
do not participate directly but, 
instead, choose their representatives 
through an election process. These 
representatives meet and make 

Nowhere in the 
world have gover


nments willingly 
shared power. 

All over Europe 
and USA, 

women and 
the poor have 

had to fight for 
participation 

in government. 
Women's 

struggle to vote 
got strengthened 

during the First World 
War. This movement is called the 
women's suffrage movement as 
the term suffrage usually means 
right to vote. 

During the War, many men were 
away fighting, and because of this 
women were called upon to do 
work that was earlier considered 
men's work. Many women began 
organising and managing 
different kinds of work. When 
people saw this they began to 
wonder why they had created so 
many unfair stereotypes about 
women and what they were 
capable of doing. So women 
began to be seen as being equally 
capable of making decisions. 

The suffragettes demanded the 
right to vote for all women and to 
get their demands heard they 
chained themselves to railings in 
public places. Many suffragettes 
were imprisoned and went on 
hunger strikes,and they had to be 
fed by force. American women got 
the right to vote in 1920 while 
women in the UK got to vote on 
the same terms as men some 
years later, in 1928.

decisions for the entire population. 
These days a government cannot call 
itself democratic unless it allows what 
is known as universal adult franchise. 
This means that all adults in the 
country are allowed to vote. 

But it was not always like this. 
Can you believe that there was a time 
when governments did not allow 
women and the poor to participate in 
elections? In their earliest forms 
governments allowed only men who 
owned property and were educated, to 
vote. This meant that women, the 
poor, the property less and the 
uneducated were not allowed to vote. 
The country was governed by the 
rules and regulations that these few 
men made! 

In India, before Independence, only 
a small minority was allowed to vote 
and they therefore came together to 
determine the fate of the majority. 
Several people including Gandhiji 
were shocked at the unfairness of this 
practice and demanded that all adults 
have the right to vote. This is known 
as universal adult franchise. 

Writing in the journal Young India 
in 1931, Gandhiji said, "I cannot 
possibly bear the idea that a man who 
has got wealth should get the vote but 
a man who has got character but no 
wealth or literacy should have no vote, 
or that a man who honestly works by 
the sweat of his brow day in and day 
out should not have the vote for the 
crime of being a poor man…".

pictures of a young schoolboy of around 
fifteen years of age. When she asked 
her mother who the boy was, she was 
told that he was called, Hector Ndlovu. 

Her mother explained that South 
Africa was earlier governed by 
apartheid laws. Apartheid means 
separation on the basis of race. South 
African people were divided into white, 
black, Indian and coloured races. 
According to the law, these races were 
not allowed to mingle with each other, to 
live near each other or even to use 
common facilities. 

Maya could not believe her ears. 
Maya's mother sounded angry when 
she spoke about life under apartheid. 
She told Maya that in those days 



36 / Social and Political Life 


hospitals were separate and so were 
ambulances. An ambulance meant for 
white people would always be well 
equipped while one meant for black 
people was not. There were separate 
trains and buses. Even the busstops 
were different for black and white 
people. 

Non-whites were not allowed to 
vote. The best land in the country was 
reserved for the white people, and nonwhites 
had to live on the worst 
available land. Thus blacks and 
coloured people were not considered to 
be equal to whites. 

One black township was the south 
western township or Soweto. Hector 
Ndlovu lived here and he and his 
classmates joined the protest against 
learning the Afrikaans language in 
school. This was the language that the 

whites spoke. Hector and other school 
students were being forced to learn 
this language but they wanted to learn 
their own language, Zulu. The South 
African police beat up the protestors 
mercilessly and shot at the crowd. 
One of their bullets killed Hector. This 
was on 30th of April,1976. 

The African National Congress, a 
group of people who led the struggle 
against apartheid, and their most well 
known leader, Nelson Mandela fought 
the apartheid system for several 
years. Finally, they succeeded and in 
1994 South Africa became a 
democratic country in which people of 
all races were considered equal. 

What were Hector and his classmates 

protesting about?

a democratic government means to all 
of us. 

PARTICIPATION 

Why do we have regular elections? 
You've already read in the previous 
chapter that people make the 
decisions in a democracy. Through 
voting in elections people elect leaders 
to represent them. These representatives 
take decisions on behalf of the

the tiger population in India is 
falling. Tigers are being 


hunted and killed by poachers 
for their skins. The 
government has not taken the 
issue of poaching seriously 
enough. It must take action 
immediately, arrest the 
poachers and implement the 
laws protecting the tiger. If 
this does not happen the tiger 
will become an extinct animal 
in the next ten years.

people. In doing so it is assumed that 
they will keep in mind the voices and 
interests of the people. 

Discuss 

Look at some newspapers and 
discuss some elections that you 
may have read about. Why do 
you think elections are required 
after a fixed period? 

All governments are elected for fixed 
periods. In India this period is five years. 
Once elected, governments can stay in 
power only for that period. If they want 
to continue to be in power then they 
have to be re-elected by the people. This 
is a moment when people can sense 
their power in a democracy. In this way 
the power of the government gets 
limited by regular elections. 

Not bad! One of the taps in the nearby 
village must be getting water! 


Key Elements of a Democratic Government / 37 

Other ways of participating 

Elections are usually held once in five 
years. Besides voting there are other 
ways of participating in the process of 
government. People participate by 
taking an interest in the working of 
the government and by criticising it 
when required. In August 2005, when 
a particular government increased the 
money people had to pay for 
electricity, people expressed their 
disapproval very sharply. They took 
out rallies and also organised a 
signature campaign. The government 
tried to explain and defend its 
decision but finally listened to the 
people's opinion and withdrew the 
increase. The government had to 
change its decision because it is 
responsible to the people. 

Take Action 


38 / Social and Political Life 
There are many ways in which 
people express their views and make 
governments understand what 
actions they should take. These 
include dharnas, rallies, strikes, 
signature campaigns etc. Things that 
are unfair and unjust are also 
brought forward. Newspapers, 
magazines and TV also play a role in 
discussing government issues and 
responsibilities. 


While it is true that a democracy 
allows people to participate, it is also 
true that not all sections of people are 
actually able to do so. Another way for 
people to participate is by organising 
themselves into social movements 
that seek to challenge the government 
and its functioning. Members of the 
minority community, dalits, adivasis, 
women and others are often able to 
participate in this manner. 

If a country's people are alert and 
interested in how the country is run, 
the democratic character of the 
government of that country will be 
stronger. 

So the next time we see a rally 
winding through the streets of our 
cities and towns or villages we should 
pause to find out what the rally is 
about, who is participating in it, and 
what they are protesting about. This 
will help to give us a sense of how our 
government works. 

NEED TO RESOLVE CONFLICT 

In Maya's story you read about how 
conflicts can often lead to violence 
and death because one group decides 
that it is all right to use force to 
prevent the other group from 
protesting. 

Read the story again: Do you 
think the police shooting of 
Hector could have been 
avoided? How? 
Conflicts occur when people of 
different cultures, religions, regions or 
economic backgrounds do not get 
along with each other, or when some 
among them feel they are being 
discriminated against. People may use 
violent means to settle their 
differences. This leads to fear and 
tension among others living in an 
area. The government is responsible 
for helping to resolve conflicts. 

Let's read about some of the 
conflicts in our society and the role of 
the government in resolving them. 



The Indian Constitution lays 
down the basic rules or laws that 
have to be followed by everyone. 
These laws are for both the 
government and the people. 
Conflicts and differences have to 
be resolved according to these 
laws. We will read more about 
this in later classes. 
The Indian Constitution lays 
down the basic rules or laws that 
have to be followed by everyone. 
These laws are for both the 
government and the people. 
Conflicts and differences have to 
be resolved according to these 
laws. We will read more about 
this in later classes. 
Religious processions and 
celebrations can sometimes lead to 
conflicts. For example, the route a 
procession takes may lead to a conflict. 
The government, particularly the 
police play an important role in 
getting representatives of concerned 
communities to meet and try and 
arrive at a solution. At times there is 
fear that violence may erupt, with 
people throwing stones or trying to 
disrupt the procession. The police is 
responsible for ensuring that violence 
does not take place. 

Rivers too can become a source of 
conflict between states. A river may 
begin in one place, flow through 

Key Elements of a Democratic Government / 39 
another and end in a third. The 
sharing of river water between 
different places that the river goes 
through is becoming an issue of 
conflict. For example you may have 
heard about the Cauvery water 
dispute between Karnataka and 
Tamil Nadu. The water stored in 
Krishnasagar dam in Karnataka is 
used for irrigating a number of 
districts and for meeting the needs of 
the city of Bangalore. The water stored 
in Mettur dam in Tamil Nadu is used 
for crops grown in the delta region of 
that state. 

A conflict arises because both dams 
are on the same river. The downstream 
dam in Tamil Nadu can only be filled 
up if water is released from the 
upstream one located in Karnataka. 
Therefore, both states can't get as 
much water as they need for people in 
their states. This leads to conflict. The 
central government has to step in and 
see that a fair distribution is worked 
out for both states. 

Quiet flows the Cauvery despite being at the centre of 
heated conflict between two states for the last 30 years.

EQUALITY AND JUSTICE 

One of the key ideas of a democratic 
government is its commitment to 
equality and justice. Equality and 
justice are inseparable. 

Discuss 

In Maya's story did the government 

support the idea that people are 

equal? 

In Dr Ambedkar's story did the 

practice of untouchability support 

the idea that people are equal? 

The earlier practice of untouch-
ability is now banned by law. This 
group of people were denied education, 
transport or medical facilities and 
even the chance to offer prayers. 
Dr Ambedkar, whom you have read 
about earlier in this book, and many 
others like him, realised that such 
practices must not continue and that 
justice can only be achieved when 
people are treated equally. 

QUESTIONS 

The government also recognises 
this and makes special provisions for 
groups within society that are unequal. 
For instance, in our society there is a 
general tendency to value and care for 
the boy child more than the girl child. 

This means that society does not 
value the girl and boy child equally and 
this is unjust. In this context the 
government steps in to promote justice 
by providing special provisions that 
can enable girls to overcome the 
injustice that they are subjected to. 
Thus it is possible that fees for girls 
might be waived or lowered in 
government schools or colleges. 

How do you think lowering the school 
fees would help girls attend school? 
Can you think of any experience from 
your life in which you have helped 
someone out of a situation which you 
thought was unfair? Did everyone else 
see it the same way? What did you 
have to say to convince others that 
what you did was fair? 
1. How would Maya's life be different in South Africa today? 
2. What are the various ways in which people participate in the process 
of government? 
3. Why do you think we need the government to find solutions to many 
disputes or conflicts? 
4. What actions does the government take to ensure that all people are 
treated equally? 
5. Read through the chapter and discuss some of the key ideas of a 
democratic government. Make a list. For example, all people are 
equal. 

Chapter 5 

What happens after people elect their 
representatives? How are decisions made? Let's 
look at how this takes place in rural areas. Here, 
we look at the Gram Sabha, which is a meeting

Panchayati Raj 

where people directly participate and seek 

answers from their elected representatives. 

The people of Hardas village are keen 
to find out what their new Panchayat 
t's a special day today! Everyone's 
rushing to get to the Gram Sabha!

I 

Do you know why? Because the Gram 
Sabha is holding its first meeting after 
theelection of thenew Gram Panchayat. 

The Gram Sabha is a meeting of all 
adults who live in the area covered 
by a Panchayat. This could be only 
one village or a few villages. In some 
states, as in the example above, a 
village meeting is held for each 
village. Anyone who is 18 years old 
or more and who has the right to vote 
is a member of the Gram Sabha. 
leaders have planned for the village. 

Gram Sabha 

The Gram Sabha meeting begins with 
the Panchayat President (who is also 
called the Sarpanch) and the members 
of the Panchayat (the Panchs) 
presenting a plan on repairing the road 
that connects the village to the main 
highway. After this, the discussion 
moves to the subject of water and 
water shortages. 



44 / Social and Political Life 

Every village Panchayat is 
divided into wards, i.e. smaller 
areas. Each ward elects a 
representative who is known as 
the Ward Member (Panch). All 
the members of the Gram Sabha 
also elect a Sarpanch who is the 
Panchayat President. The Ward 
Panchs and the Sarpanch form 
the Gram Panchayat. The Gram 
Panchayat is elected for five 
years. 
The Gram Panchayat has a 
Secretary who is also the 
Secretary of the Gram Sabha. 
This person is not an elected 
person but is appointed by the 
government. The Secretary is 
responsible for calling the 
meeting of the Gram Sabha and 
Gram Panchayat and keeping a 
record of the proceedings. 
A villager called Tijia begins the 
meeting by saying, "The water problem 
in Hardas has become very acute. The 
hand pump water has gone well below 
the point up to which the ground has 
been drilled. We hardly get any water 
in the taps. Women have to go to the 
Suru river which is 3 k.m. away to get 
water." One of the members suggests 
piping water from the Suru and making 
an overhead tank in the village to 
increase the supply. But the others 
think that this will be expensive. It's 
better, they feel, to deepen the 
handpumps and clean the wells for this 
season. Tijia says, "This is not enough. 

We need to do something more 
permanent as groundwater levels seem 
to be going down every year. We're 
using more water than is seeping into 
the ground." 

Another member, Anwar then tells 
everyone that he has seen ways of 
conserving water and recharging 
(refilling) it in a village in Maharashtra 
where he'd once gone to visit his 
brother. It was called watershed 
development and he had heard that the 
government gave money for this work. 

In his brother's village people had 
planted trees, constructed check-dams 
and tanks. Everyone thought this was 
an interesting idea and the Gram 
Panchayat was asked to find out about 
it in detail. 

1. What is a Gram Sabha? 
2. In the meeting of the Gram 
Sabha so far what are the 
problems that are being 
discussed? What sort of solutions 
are being suggested? 
The next item on the agenda for the 
Gram Sabha is the finalisation of the 
list of people below the poverty line 
(BPL) which had to be approved by the 
Gram Sabha. As soon as the list is read 
out people begin to whisper. "Natwar 
has just bought a colour T.V. and his 
son has sent him a new motorcycle. 
How can he be below the poverty line?" 
Soorajmal mutters to the person sitting 
next to him. Saroj says to Sukhi bai 
"How did Birju's name get on to the list? 
He has so much land. This list should 



Panchayati a / 45 

The Gram Sabha is a 
key factor in making 
the Gram Panchayat 
play its role and be 
responsible. It is the 
place where all plans for 
the work of the Gram 
Panchayat are placed 
before the people. 
The Gram Sabha 
prevents the Panchayat 
from doing wrong things 
like misusing money 
or favouring certain 
people. It plays an 
important role in keeping

representatives and in 
making them responsible 
to the persons who 
elected them. 
have only poor people. And Om 
Prakash is a landless labourer who can 
barely make ends meet, yet his name is 
not on the list." "You know that both 
Natwar and Birju are friends of 
Amirchand's. Who can counter 
Amirchand's power?' Sukhi Bai says, 
"Amirchand was the earlier Zamindar 
(landowner) of the village and still has 
control over a lot of land. But we should 
get Om Prakash's name put in." 

The Sarpanch (Panchayat President) 
notices people whispering and 
asks if anyone has anything to say. 
Saroj tries to provoke Soorajmal to ask 
about Natwar and Birju. But he keeps 
quiet. Amirchand is sitting in the Gram 
Sabha keeping an eye on everyone. 
Then Saroj gets up and says that Om 
Prakash's name should be in the BPL 
list. Others agree that he and his family 
are very poor. The Sarpanch asks how 
his name had been missed out. The 
teacher who did the survey of BPL 

families says, "Om Prakash's house 
was locked when I went there. He may 
have gone somewhere to look for work." 
The Sarpanch gives instructions that 
Om Prakash's family income be looked 
at and if it is less than what has been 
decided by the government, his name 
should be included in the list. 

1. Was there a problem with the BPL 
list that the Gram Sabha was 
finalising? What was this problem? 
2. Why do you think Soorajmal kept 
quiet even though Saroj asked him to 
speak? 
3. Have you seen any similar 
incidents when people are unable to 
speak for themselves? Why do you 
think that happened and what 
prevented the person from speaking? 
4. How can the Gram Sabha prevent 
the Panchayat from doing what it 
likes? 

46 / Social and Political Life 

The Gram Panchayat 

The Gram Panchayat meets regularly 
and one of its main tasks is to 
implement development programmes 
for all villages that come under it. As 
you have seen, the work of the Gram 
Panchayat has to be approved by the 
Gram Sabha. 

In some states, Gram Sabhas form 
committees like construction and 
development committees. These 
committees include some members of 
the Gram Sabha and some from the 
Gram Panchayat who work together to 
carry out specific tasks. 

Two village Panchs from Maharashtra who were 
awarded the Nirmal Gram Puruskar in 2005 for 
the excellent work done by them in the Panchayat. 


The work of a Gram Panchayat 
includes 
1. The construction and maintenance 
of water sources, roads, drainage, 
school buildings and other 
common property resources. 
2. Levying and collecting local taxes. 
3. Executing government schemes 
related to generating employment 
in the village.

Donations for community works etc. 
Let's see what the Hardas Gram 
Panchayat was able to do. 

Do you remember the options that 
were suggested to solve the water 
problem in the Gram Sabha of Hardas 
village? When the Hardas Gram 
Panchayat held a meeting, this point 
was brought up again by some of the 
members (Panchs). This meeting was 
attended by the Sarpanch, Ward 
Members (Panchs) and the Secretary. 

Gram Panchayat members first 
discussed the suggestion to deepen two 
handpumps and clean one well, so that 
the village would not go without water. 
The Sarpanch (Panchayat President) 
suggested that since the Panchayat had 
received some money for maintenance 
of handpumps, this could be used 



for completing this work. The 
members agreed and the Secretary 
recorded their decision. 

The members then went on to 
discuss the options for a long-term 
solution. They were sure that the 
Gram Sabha members would ask 
questions at the next meeting. Some 
Panchs asked whether the watershed 
programme would make a substantial 
difference to the water level. A lot of 
discussion followed. In the end it was 
decided that the Gram Panchayat 
would approach the Block 
Development Officer and get more 
information on the scheme. 

What decisions were taken by the 
Gram panchayat? 
Do you think it was necessary for 
them to take these decisions? 
Why? 
From the above description, write 
down one question that people 
could ask of the Panchayat in the 
next Gram Sabha meeting.

Three Levels of Panchayats 

After reading about what happened in 
the Gram Sabha and the Gram 
Panchayat in Hardas village you can 
understand that the Panchayati Raj 
System is a process through which 
people participate in their own 
government. The Panchayati Raj 
system is the first tier or level of 
democratic government. The Panchs 
and the Gram Panchayat are 
answerable to the Gram Sabha 
because it is the members of the Gram 
Sabha who elected them. 

This idea of people's participation 
in the Panchayati Raj system extends 
to two other levels. One is the Block 
level, which is called the Janpad 
Panchayat or the Panchayat Samiti. 
The Panchayat Samiti has many Gram 
Panchayats under it. Above the 
Panchayat Samiti is the District 
Panchayat or the Zila Parishad. The

level. With the help of Panchayat 
Samitis, it also regulates the money 
distribution among all the Gram 
Panchayats. 
Within the guidelines given in the 
Constitution each state in the country 
has its own laws with regard to 
Panchayats. The idea is to provide

Nimone is a village on the Chauphula-Shirur Road. Like many others, this village 
has also been facing a severe water shortage for the last few months and villagers 
depend on tankers for all their needs. Bhagvan Mahadeo Lad (35) of this village was 
beaten with sticks, iron rods and axes by a group of seven men. The incident came 
to light when some villagers brought a badly injured Lad to hospital for treatment. 
In the FIR recorded by the police Lad said that he was attacked when he insisted 
that the water in the tanker must be emptied into the storage tanks constructed as 
part of the water supply scheme by Nimone Gram Panchayat so that there would be 
equal distribution of water. However, he alleged that the upper caste men were 
against this and told him that the tanker water was not meant for the lower castes.

take over some of Mohan's land, and 
increased the size of his own field. 
Mohan was angry but also a little 
frightened. Raghu's family owned 
many fields and besides, his uncle 
was also the Sarpanch of the village. 
But even so, he plucked up courage 
and went to Raghu's house. 

A heated argument followed. 
Raghu refused to accept that he had 
moved the bund. He called one of his 
helpers and they began shouting at 
Mohan and beating him up. The 
neighbours heard the commotion 
and rushed to the spot where Mohan 
was being beaten up. They took him 
away. 

He was badly hurt on his head 
and hand. He was given first aid by 
one of his neighbours. His friend, 
who also ran the village post-office, 
suggested that they go to the local 
police station and file a report. 
Others were doubtful if this was a good 
idea because they felt they would 
waste a lot of money and nothing 
which they have been farming for would come out of it. Some people said

Area of the Police Station 

On the way to the police station one of 
the neighbours asked, "Why don't we 
spend some more money and go to the 
main police station in the town?" 

"It is not a question of money. We 
can register the case only in this police 
station because our village comes in its 
area of work," explained Mohan. 

Every police station has an area 
that comes under its control. All 
persons in that area can report cases or 
inform the police about any theft, 
accident, injury, fight, etc. It is the 

responsibility of the police of that 
station to enquire, to investigate and 
take action on the cases within its area. 

1. If there is a theft in your house 
which police station would you go 
to to register your complaint? 
2. What was the dispute between 
Mohan and Raghu? 
3. Why was Mohan worried about 
picking a quarrel with Raghu? 
4. Some people said Mohan should 
report the matter to the police and 
others said he should not. What 
were the arguments they gave? 
The work at the Police Station 

When they reached the police station 
Mohan went to the person in charge 
(Station House Officer or S.H.O.) and 
told him what had happened. He also 
said that he wanted to give the 
complaint in writing. The S.H.O rudely 
brushed him aside saying that he 
couldn't be bothered to waste his time 
writing down minor complaints and 


then investigating them. Mohan 
showed him his injuries but the S.H.O 
did not believe him. 

Mohan was puzzled and did not 
know what to do. He was not sure why 
his complaint was not being recorded. 
He went and called his neighbours into 
the office. They argued strongly that 
Mohan had been beaten up in front of 
them and had they not rescued him he

would have been injured very 
seriously. They insisted that the case 
be registered. Finally the officer agreed. 
He asked Mohan to write down his 
complaint and also told the people that 
he would send a constable the next day 
to investigate the incident. 



Maintenance of Land Records 

You saw that Mohan and Raghu were 
arguing heatedly whether the common 
boundary of their fields had been 
shifted. Isn't there a way by which they 
could have settled this dispute in a 
peaceful manner? Are there records 
that show who owns what land in the 
village? Let's find out how this is done. 

Measuring land and keeping land 
records is the main work of the 
Patwari. The Patwari is known by 
different names in different states - in 
some villages such officers are 
called Lekhpal, in others Kanungo or 


Rural Administration / 51 
Karamchari or Village Officer etc. We 
will refer to this officer as Patwari. 
Each Patwari is responsible for a 
group of villages. The Patwari 
maintains and updates the records of 
the village. 

The map and the corresponding 
details from the register on the next 
page are a small part of the records 
kept by the Patwari. 

The Patwari usually has ways of 
measuring agricultural fields. In some 
places a long chain is used. In the 
above instance the Patwari would have 
measured both Mohan's and Raghu's 
fields and compared them with the 
measurements on the map. If they did 
not match then it would be clear that 
the boundary of the fields has been 
changed. 

Find out the term used for the Patwari 
in your state. 
If you live in a rural area find out: 
How many villages does the Patwari of 
your area maintain land records of? 
How do people in the village contact 
him/her? 
The Patwari is also responsible for 
organising the collection of land 
revenue from the farmers and 
providing information to the government 
about the crops grown in this 
area. This is done from the records 
that are kept, and this is why it's 
important for the Patwari to regularly 
update these. Farmers may change 
the crops grown on their fields or 
someone may dig a well somewhere,

PATWARI RECORD 16 

and keeping track of all this is the 
work of the revenue department of 
the government. Senior people in 
this department supervise the 
Patwari's work. 

All states in India are divided 
into districts. For managing matters 
relating to land these districts are 
further sub-divided. These subdivisions 
of a district are known by 
different names such as tehsil, 
taluka, etc. At the head is the 
District Collector and under her are 
the revenue officers, also known as 
tehsildars. They have to hear 
disputes. They also supervise the 
work of the Patwaris and ensure 
that records are properly kept and 
land revenue is collected. They 
make sure that the farmers can 
easily obtain a copy of their record, 
students can obtain their caste 
certificates etc. The Tehsildar's 
office is where land disputes are 
also heard. 


Rural Administration / 53 

Farmers often require a copy of their land's 
record together with a map, as shown in 
the previous illustration. They have a right 
to this information. They may have to pay 
a small fee for this. 
However, this information is not easily 
made available and farmers sometimes 
have to face many problems to get it. In 
some states, records are now being 
computerised and also kept at the 
Panchayat office so that they are more 
easily available and regularly updated. 
When do you think farmers may require a 
copy of this record? Study the following 
situations and identify the cases in which 
these records would be necessary and why. 
* A farmer wants to buy a plot of land from 
another. 
* A farmer wants to sell her produce to 
another. 
* A farmer wants a loan from the bank to 
dig a well in her land. 
* A farmer wants to purchase fertilizers for 
his field. 
* A farmer wants to divide his property 
among his children. 
A daughter's wish 

Father inherited our house 
from his father 
And everyone says he'll

A New Law 

(Hindu Succession Amendment Act, 
2005) 

Often when we think of farmers who 
own land, we think of men. Women are 
seen as people who work on the fields, 
but not as people who own 
agricultural land. Till recently in some 
states Hindu women did not get a 
share in the family's agricultural land. 
After the death of the father his 
property was divided equally only 
among his sons. 

Recently, the law was changed. In 
the new law sons, daughters and their 
mothers can get an equal share in the 
land. The same law will apply to all 
states and union territories of the 
country. 

This law will benefit a large number 
of women. For example Sudha is the 
eldest daughter of an agricultural 
family. She is married and lives in a 
neighbouring village. After her father's 
death Sudha often comes to help her 
mother with the farming work. 

Her mother has asked the Patwari 
to transfer the land and enter her 
name along with the names of all the 
children in his record. 

Sudha's mother confidently 
organises the farming with the help of 
the younger brother and sister. 
Similarly Sudha also lives with the 
assurance that if she ever has a 
problem she can always depend upon 
her share of the land. 

Other Public Services - A survey 

This chapter has looked at some of the administrative work of the 
government, especially for rural areas. The first example related to 
maintaining law and order and the second to maintaining land records. 
In the first case we examined the role of the police and in the second 
that of the Patwari. This work is supervised by other people in the 
department, such as the Tehsildar or the Superintendent of Police. We 
have also seen how people use these services, and some of the problems 
that they face. These services have to be used and made to function 
according to the laws that have been framed for them. You have 
probably seen many other public services and facilities provided by 
various departments of the government. 

Do the following exercise for your village/by visiting a nearby village or 

looking at your own area. 
List the public services in the village/area such as: the milk society, the 
fair price shop, the bank, the police station, the agricultural society for 
seeds and fertiliser, the post office or sub post office, the anganwadi, 
crèche, government school/s, health centre or government hospital etc. 
Collect information on three public services and discuss with your 
teacher how improvements can be made in their functioning. One 
example has been worked out.

Chapter 7 

Urban 
Administration 

A city is much bigger than a village and more spread 
out. A city has crowded markets, many buses and 
cars, water and electricity facilities, traffic control 
and hospitals. Have you ever wondered who is 
responsible for running all this? Do you know how 
decisions are made? How the planning is done? 
Who are the people who do all the work? Read this 
chapter and find some answers. 

But Mala, Jehangir and Rehana were 
more worried about what had happened O 
ne lazy Sunday afternoon Mala 
and her friends Shankar, Jehangir 

and Rehana were playing a game of 
cricket in the street. 

Shankar had bowled a good over 
and although he nearly managed to get 
Rehana out, she was still playing. 
Frustrated, he bowled a short ball and 
hoped she would hit it for an easy catch. 
Instead, Rehana hit the ball so hard and 
so high that the street light broke. 
Rehana screamed, "Oh no, look what 
I've done!" Shankar said, "Yes! we forgot 
to make a rule that if you break the 
street light you are automatically out." 

and they told Shankar he'd better stop 
thinking about the wicket. 

Last week they had broken Nirmala 
Mausi's window and had spent their 
pocket money to have it replaced. Would 
they have to dish out money again from 
their pockets? But who would they pay 
this to? To whom did the lights on the 
streets belong? Who changed them? 

Rehana's house was the closest and 
they ran and told her mother what had 
happened. Rehana's mother said, "I 
don't really know these things in great 



58 / Social and Political Life 

detail but I do know that it is the 
Municipal Corporation of the city that 
takes care of replacing lights. The best 
person to ask would be Yasmin Khala. 
She just retired from the Municipal 
Corporation. Go and ask her, and 
Rehana come back home soon." 

Yasmin Khala lived in the same lane 
and she and Rehana's mother were 
good friends. The children ran to 
Khala's house and when she opened 
the door they began to tell her what 
had happened all at once! When they 
asked about the street light, Yasmin 
Khala laughed and said, "There is no 
one person that you can pay the money 
to. There is a big organisation called 

the Municipal Corporation that takes 
care of street lights, garbage collection, 
water supply, keeping the streets and 
the market clean." 

"I've heard about the Municipal 
Corporation. They've put up signs 
around the city to inform people about 
malaria," said Mala. 

"Yes, you are quite right. The 
Municipal Corporation is also 
responsible for ensuring that diseases 
do not break out in the city. It also runs 
schools, hospitals and dispensaries. 
And makes gardens and maintains 
them," said Yasmin Khala. Then she 
added, "Our city Pune is a big city and 

List at least four different tasks 
that the Municipality does: 
1. 

2. 
3. 
4. 


so here it is called a Municipal 
Corporation. In smaller towns it is 
called a Municipal Council." 

The Ward Councillor and 
Administrative Staff 

"Yasmin Khala, I'm curious. Who 
decides where a park should go? Did 
you have to make interesting decisions 
like this when you worked in the 
Municipal Corporation?" asked 
Rehana. 

"No Rehana, I was working in the 
accounts office of the Corporation so I 
just worked on pay slips. Cities are 
usually quite large so the Municipal 
Corporation has to make a lot of 
decisions as well as do a lot of work to 
keep the city clean. The decisions like 
where a park or a new hospital should 
go are usually made by the Ward 
Councillors." 



The city is divided into different 
wards and ward councillors get 
elected. The complicated decisions that 
affect the entire city are taken by 
groups of councillors who form committees 
to decide and debate issues. For 
example, if bus stands need to be 
improved, or a crowded market-place 
needs to have its garbage cleared more 
regularly, or there is a 'nala' or drain 
that cuts through the city that needs 
cleaning etc. It is these committees for 
water, garbage collection, street lighting 
etc. that decide on the work to be done. 

When the problems are within a 
ward then the people who live in the 
ward can contact their councillors. For 
example, if there are dangerous 
electrical wires hanging down then the 
local Councillor can help them get in 
touch with the electricity authority. 

While the Councillor's Committees 
and the councillors decide on issues, 
the Commissioner and the administrative 
staff implement these. The 
Commissioner and the administrative 
staff are appointed. Councillors are 
elected. 

"So how are these decisions made?" 
said Rehana who never gave up on her 
train of thought. 

"Well, all of the Ward Councillors 
meet and they make a budget and the 
money is spent according to this. The 
Ward Councillors try and ensure that 
the particular demands of their ward 
are placed before the entire council. 
These decisions are then implemented 
by the administrative staff," said 
Yasmin Khala, enjoying the questions

How does the Municipal 
Corporation get its money? 
Providing and running so many 
services requires a lot of money. The 
Municipal Corporation collects this in 
different ways. A tax is a sum of 
money that people pay to the 
government for the services the 
government provides. People who 
own homes have to pay a property tax 
as well as taxes for water and other 
services. The larger the house the 
more the tax. Property taxes however 
form only 25-30 per cent of the money 
that a Municipal Corporation earns. 
There are also taxes for education and 
other amenities. If you own a hotel or 
shop then you have to pay a tax for 
this as well. Also the next time you go 
to see a movie look carefully at your 
ticket because you pay a tax for this as 
well. Thus while rich people account 
for property taxes, a much wider 
population pays more general taxes. 

Recycling is not a new thing. People like the man in the photo

that the children asked. 
No adults asked her 
about her job and the 
children's questions 
provided her an 
opportunity to relive some 
of her experiences. 

"But the city is so 
large. It must take a lot of 
people to look after it. 
Does the Municipal 
Corporation have a lot of 
workers?" asked Shekhar 
curiously. He had by now 
luckily forgotten about the 
cricket match and his 
incomplete over. 

"Yes, the work in the 
city is divided into 
different departments. So 

there is the water 
department, the garbage collection 
department, a department to look after 
gardens, another to look after roads. I 
worked on accounts in the sanitation 
department," said Yasmin Khala and 
then went on to offer the children some 
kababs to eat. 

Jehangir ate his kababs at top 
speed and as he wolfed them down he 
asked loudly from the kitchen, "Yasmin 
Khala where does the garbage that the 
Municipal Corporation collects go to?". 
The others were still eating when 
Yasmin Khala began to answer, "This 
question has an interesting answer. As 
you know you can usually find garbage 
lying all over the street. Earlier even 
our neighbourhood used to have 
garbage lying all over, and if this 

remains uncollected it attracts dogs, 
rats and flies. Also, people get ill from 
the smell. At one point things became 
so bad that children even stopped 
playing cricket in the street because 
their parents were afraid that they'd 
get sick from staying on the streets too 
long." 

A Community Protest 

Yasmin Khala continued, "The women 
were very unhappy about the situation 
and even came to me for advice. I said 
I could try and speak with some officer 
in the department but I wasn't sure 
how long it would take. Then it was 
Gangabai who said that it is the Ward 
Councillor who we should go to and 
protest since we are the ones who 



What has changed since Khala 
retired? 
What Yasmin Khala did not 
mention to the children was that in 
recent times, in order to save money 
the Commissioners of several 
municipalities across the country 
had hired private contractors to 
collect and process garbage. This is 
called Sub-Contracting. This means 
that the work that was earlier being 
done by government workers is now 
being done by a private company. 
These contract workers get paid less 
and their jobs are temporary. 
Collecting garbage is also quite a 
dangerous job and often these 
contract workers do not have any 
access to safety measures and are 
not taken care of if they are injured 
while working.

elected him. She gathered a small 
group of women and went to his house. 
They began shouting slogans in front of 
his house and he came out and asked 
them what was wrong. 

Gangabai described the situation in 
the locality to him. He promised to go 
with them the next day to meet the 
Commissioner. He asked Gangabai to 
get a petition signed by all of the adults 
in the locality saying that garbage was 
not being collected. He suggested that 
taking the local sanitation engineer 
with them the next day might be a good 
idea. The sanitation engineer could also 
speak with the Commissioner and tell 
him how bad the situation was. That 
evening children ran from house to 

Urban Administration / 61 

house making sure that as many 
families as possible signed the petition. 

The next morning a large group of 
women and the Ward Councillor and 
the sanitation engineer went to the 
Municipal Corporation office. The 
Commissioner met with this large group 
and began giving excuses saying that 
the Corporation did not have enough 
trucks. But Gangabai smartly replied, 
"But you seem to have enough trucks to 
collect garbage from the rich localities". 

"That must have left him lost for 
words," quipped Jehangir. 

"Yes, he said that he would take 
care of it immediately and Gangabai 
threatened that if it was not done in 
two days a larger group of women 
would protest in front of the 
Corporation," said Yasmin Khala. "So 
did the streets get cleaned?" asked 
Rehana who never let things remain 
unfinished. 

"Well not within two days and then 
after another larger and more noisy 
protest the sanitation service in this 
locality became more regular."

about?

said Mala who already began 
imagining herself in the lead role of 
Gangabai. 

The children enjoyed hearing 
Gangabai's story immensely. They 
had sensed that Gangabai was much 
loved and respected and now they 
understood why. They got up and 
thanked Khala for answering their 
questions and then, before they left, 
Rehana said, "Oh I have one last 
question Khala. The two dustbins that 
we have at home now, are they also 
Gangabai's idea?" 

Khala began laughing. "No, not 
really. The Municipal Corporation was 
the one who suggested that we do this 
to help keep our streets clean. When we 
sort our own garbage it reduces their 
work." 

The children thanked Khala 
and walked back down the street 
together. It had become quite late 
and they needed to get back home. 
For some reason the street seemed 
darker than usual. They looked 
up and then looked at each other 
smiling and ran right back to 
Khala's house… 

The city of Surat had a plague scare in 1994. Surat was one of 
the dirtiest cities in India. Houses hotels and restaurants would 
dump their garbage into the nearest drain or street which made 
it very difficult for sweepers to collect and transfer the garbage 
into selected dumps. In addition to this the Municipal Council 
did not collect the garbage as often as it should have and this 
led to the situation getting worse. Plague spreads through the 
air and people who have the disease have to be isolated. In 
Surat, several people lost their lives, and over 300,000 deserted 
the town. The scare of the plague ensured that the municipal 
council completely cleaned up the city. To this date Surat 
continues to remain the second cleanest city in India after 
Chandigarh.

neighbourhood? Do you think it is the same for all 
neighbourhoods of the city? Why not? Discuss.

iii) Why do you think that proper ways of disposing garbage are not 
available to those who work in municipalities? 
7. Several poor people in the city work as domestic servants as well as 
work for the Corporation, keeping the city clean. Yet the slums in 
which they live are quite filthy. This is because these slums seldom 
have any water and sanitation facilities. The reason often given by 
the Municipal Corporation is that the land in which the poor have 
set up their homes does not belong to them and that slum-dwellers 
do not pay taxes. However people living in middle class 
neighbourhoods pay very little in taxes compared to the amount of 
money the corporation spends on them in setting up parks, street 
lighting facilities, regular garbage collection etc. Also as you read in 
this chapter, the property taxes collected by the Municipality makes 
up only 25-30 per cent of its money. Why do you think it is 
important that the Corporation should spend more money on slum 
localities? Why is it important that the Municipal Corporation 
provide the poor in the city with the same facilities that the rich get?

different regions has an effect on the work people do, 
the kinds of plants, trees, crops or things that become 
important to them. In this chapter we will look at the 
different ways in which people earn their living in 
villages. And here too, as in the first two chapters, 
we will examine whether people have equal 
opportunities to earn a living. We will look at the 
similarities in their life situations and the problems 
that they face.

Kalpattu village 

K
K
alpattu is a village that's close to 

the sea coast in Tamil Nadu. 
People here do many kinds of work. 
As in other villages, here too there is 

non-farm work such as making 
baskets, utensils, pots, bricks, 
bullock-carts etc. 

There are people who provide 
services such as blacksmiths, nurses, 
teachers, washermen, weavers, 
barbers, cycle repair mechanics and 
so on. There are also some 
shopkeepers and traders. In the main 
street, which looks like a bazaar, you

will find a variety of small shops such 
as tea shops, grocery shops, barber 
shops, a cloth shop, a tailor and two 
fertiliser and seed shops. There are 
four teashops, which sell tiffin – such 
as idli, dosai and upama in the 

morning and snacks like vadai, bonda 
and mysorepak in the evening. Near 
the teashops in a corner lives a 
blacksmith family whose home serves 
as their workshop. Next to their home 
is a cycle hire and repair shop. Two 
families earn a living by washing 
clothes. There are some people who go 
to the nearby town to work as 
construction workers and lorry 
drivers. 

The village is surrounded by low 
hills. Paddy is the main crop that is 
grown in irrigated lands. Most of the 

families earn a living through 
agriculture. 
There are some 

coconut groves around. 
Cotton, sugar cane and 
plantain are also 
grown, and there are 
mango orchards. Let 
us now meet some 
people who work in the 
fields in Kalpattu and 
see what we can learn 
about farming from 
them. 

Thulasi 

All of us here work on 
Ramalingam's land. 
He has twenty acres 
of paddy fields in 

Kalpattu. Even before I was married I 
used to work on paddy fields in my 
parental village. I work from 8.30 in 
the morning till 4.30 in the evening and 
Karuthamma, Ramalingam's wife, 
supervises us. 



This is one of the few times in the 
year that I find regular work. Now I 
am transplanting the paddy, when the 
plants have grown a bit Ramalingam 
will call us again for weeding and then 
finally once again for the harvesting. 

When I was young I could do this 
work with no difficulty. But now as I 
grow older I find bending for long 
hours with my feet in water very 
painful. Ramalingam pays Rs 40 per 
day. This is a little less than what 
labourers get in my home village, but I 
come here because I can depend on 
him to call me whenever there is work. 
Unlike others, he does not go looking 
for cheaper labour from other villages. 

My husband, Raman is also a 
labourer. We don't own any land. 
During this time of the year he sprays 
pesticides. When there is no work on 

Rural Livelihoods / 69 

the farm he finds work outside, either 
loading sand from the river or stone 
from the quarry nearby. This is sent by 
truck to be used in nearby towns to 
make houses. 

Apart from working on the land, I do 
all the tasks at home. I cook food for my 
family, clean the house and wash 
clothes. I go with other women to the 
nearby forest to collect firewood. About 
one kilometre away we have a village 
borewell from where I fetch water. My 
husband helps in getting materials 
such as groceries for the house. 

Our school-going daughters are the 
joy of our lives. Last year, one of them 
fell ill and had to be taken to the 
hospital in town. We had to sell our 
cow to pay back the money we 
borrowed from Ramalingam for her 
treatment.

Based on the above diagram would 
you say that Thulasi earns money 
throughout the year? 
1. Describe the work that 
Thulasi does. How is it 
different from the work 
Raman does? 
2. Thulasi gets paid very little 
money for the work she 
does. Why do you think 
agricultural labourers like 
her are forced to accept low 
wages? 
3. In what ways would her way 
of earning a living have 
been different if Thulasi 
owned some farm land? 
Discuss. 
4. What are the crops grown in 
your region or nearby 
rural area? What kinds 
of work do agricultural 
labourers do? 

70 / Social and Political Life 
As you saw in Thulasi's story poor 
families in rural areas often spend a 
lot of time every day collecting 
firewood, getting water and grazing 
their cattle. 

Even though they do not earn any 
money from these activities they have 
to do them for the household. The 
family needs to spend time doing this 
as they are not able to survive on the 
little money they earn. 

Nearly two-fifth of all rural families 
are agricultural labourers in our 
country. There are some who have 
small plots of land while others like 
Thulasi are landless. 

Not being able to earn money 
throughout the year forces people in 
many rural areas to travel long 
distances in search of work. This 
travel, or migration, takes place 
during particular seasons. 

Sekar 

We have to carry this paddy to our 
house. My family has just finished 


harvesting our field. We don't own 
much land, only two acres. We manage 
to do all the work on our own. At 
times, especially during the harvest I 
take the help of other small farmers 
and in turn help them harvest their 
field. 

The trader gave me seeds and 
fertilisers as a loan. To pay back this 
loan I have to sell my paddy to him at 
a somewhat lower price than what I 
would get in the market. He has sent 
his agent to remind farmers who have 
taken loans that they will sell the 
paddy only to him. 

I will probably get 60 bags of paddy 
from my field. Some of this I will sell to 
settle the loan. The rest will be used in 
my home. But whatever I have will last 
only eight months. So I need to earn 
some money. I work in Ramalingam's 
rice mill. Here I help him collect paddy 
from other farmers in the neighbouring 
villages. 

We also have a hybrid cow, whose 
milk we sell in the local milk 

cooperative. This way we get a little 
extra money for our everyday needs. 

On being in Debt 

As you've read above, very often 
farmers like Sekar need to borrow 
money to purchase basic things like 

seeds, fertilisers and pesticides. Often 
they borrow this money from 
moneylenders. If the seeds are not of 
good quality or pests attack their crop 
there can be a major crop failure. 



The crops can also be ruined 
if the monsoon does not bring 
enough rain. When this happens 
farmers sometimes are unable 
to pay back their loans. And, for 
the family to survive, they may 
even have to borrow more 
money. Soon the loan becomes 
so large that no matter what 
they earn, they are unable 
to repay. 

This is when we can say they 
are caught in debt. In recent 
years this has become a major 
cause of distress among farmers. 
In some areas this has also 
resulted in many farmers 
committing suicide. 

1. What work does Sekar's family 
do? Why do you think Sekar does 
not usually employ labourers for 
doing farming work? 
2. Why does Sekar not go to the 
town market to get a better price for 
his paddy? 
3. Sekar's sister Mina had also 
taken a loan from the trader. She 
does not want to sell her paddy to 
him but she will pay back her loan. 
Write an imaginary conversation 
between Mina and the trader's 
agent and the arguments given by 
each person. 
4. What are the similarities and 
differences between Sekar and 
Thulasi's lives? Your answer could 
be based on the land that they 
have, their need to work on the land 
that belongs to others, or loans that 
they need and their earnings.

Transplanted paddy growing in a few of 
Ramalinam's 20 acres. A result of hard labour 
performed by agricultural workers like Thulasi. 

Ramalingam and Karuthamma 

In addition to land, Ramalingam's 
family owns a rice mill and a shop 
selling seeds, pesticides etc. For the 
rice mill they used some of their own 
money and also borrowed from the 
government bank. They buy paddy 
from within the village and from 
surrounding villages. The rice that is 
produced in the mill is sold to traders 
in nearby towns. This gives them a 
substantial income. 

Read again Sekar and Thulasi's 
accounts. What do they say about 
Ramalingam, the large farmer? 
Together with what you have read 
fill in the details below: 
1. How much land does he have? 
2. What does Ramalingam do with 
the paddy grown on his land? 
3. Apart from farming how else does 
he earn?

Terrace Farming in Nagaland 
This is a village called Chizami 
which is in Phek district in 
Nagaland. The people of this 
village belong to the Chakhesang 
community. They do 'terrace' 
cultivation. 
This means that the land on a hill 
slope is made into flat plots and 
carved out in steps. The sides of 
each plot are raised in order to 
retain water. This allows water to 
stand in the field, which is best 
for rice cultivation. 
The people of Chizami have their 
own individual fields. But, they 
also work collectively in each 
other's fields. They form groups 
of six or eight and take an entire 
mountainside to clean the weeds 
on it. 
Each group eats together once 
their work for the day is over. This 
goes on for several days until the 
work is completed. 
Agricultural Labourers and Farmers 
in India 

In Kalpattu village there are 
agricultural labourers like Thulasi, 
and many small farmers like Sekar, 
and a few big farmers like 
Ramalingam. In India nearly two out 
of every five rural families are 
agricultural labourer families. All of 
them depend on the work they do on 
other people's fields to earn a living. 
Many of them are landless and others 
may own very small plots of land. 

In the case of small farmers like 
Sekhar their land is barely enough to 
meet their needs. In India 80 per cent 

of farmers belong to this group. Only 
20 per cent of India's farmers are like 
Ramalingam. These large farmers 
cultivate most of the land in the 
villages. A large part of their produce is 
sold in the market. Many of them have 
started other businesses such as 
shops, moneylending, trading, small 
factories etc. 

From the figures given above 
would you say that a majority of 
the country's farmers are quite 
poor? What do you think can be 
done to change this situation? 
We have looked at farming in 
Kalpattu. Apart from farming, many 
people in rural areas depend upon 
collection from the forest, animal 
husbandry, dairy produce, fishing etc. 
For example, in some villages in 



Rural Livelihoods / 73 

central India, both farming 
and collection from the 
forest are important 
sources of livelihood. 
Collecting mahua, tendu 
leaves, honey, to be sold to 
traders is an important 
source of additional 
income. 

Similarly selling milk to 
the village cooperative 
society or taking milk to the 
nearby town may be the 
main source of livelihood for 
some families. In the 
coastal areas, we find fishing villages. 
Let us find out more about the lives of 
a fishing family by reading about Aruna 
and Paarivelan who live in Pudupet, a 
village close to Kalpattu. 

Aruna and Paarivelan 

Not very far from Kalpattu is the 
village of Pudupet. People here earn 
their living by fishing. Their houses 
are close to the sea and one finds rows 


of catamarans and nets lying

around. At about 7 O'clock 
in the morning there is lot 
of activity on the beach. 
This is the time when the 
catamarans return with 
their catch and women 
gather to buy and sell fish. 

My husband Paarivelan, 
my brother and my 
brother-in-law came in late 
today. I was very worried. 
They go to the sea together 
in our catamaran. They 
said they were caught in a 
storm. I have kept aside 
some fish for the family. I 



74 / Social and Political Life 

will auction the rest. The money I get 
from the auction will be divided into 
four shares. One each for each person 
who went fishing and the fourth one is 
for the equipment. Since we own the 
catamaran, engine and nets, we get 
that share too. We have taken a loan 
from a bank and purchased an engine, 
which is fixed on to the catamaran. 
Now they can go far into the sea so 
that they can get a better catch. 

The women who buy fish here will 
carry it in baskets to be sold in nearby 
villages. Then there are others like 
traders who buy for the shops in the 
town. I'll only finish this auction by 
noon. In the evening my husband and 
our relatives will untangle and repair 
our nets. Early tomorrow morning 
around 2 a.m. they will set out to sea 
again. Every year, for at least about 
four months during the monsoon, they 
cannot go to the sea because this is 
when the fish breed. During these 
months we survive by borrowing from 
the trader. Because of this, later on we 
are forced to sell the fish to that trader, 
and cannot do our auction. Those lean 
months are the most difficult. Last year 
we suffered a lot because of the 
tsunami. 

Rural Livelihoods 

People in rural areas earn their living 
in various ways. Some work on farms 
while others earn their living on non-
farm activities. Working on farms 
involves operations such as preparing 
the land, sowing, weeding and 

1. Why do both Sekar's and 
Aruna's families have to borrow? 
What similarities and differences 
do you find? 
2. Have you heard of a tsunami? 
What is this and what damage do 
you think it might have done to 
the life of fishing families like 
Aruna's? 
harvesting of crops. We depend on 
nature for the growth of these crops. 
Hence life revolves around certain 
seasons. People are busy during 
sowing and harvesting and less so at 
other times. Rural people in different 
regions of the country grow different 
crops. However, we do find similarities 
in their life situations and in the 
problems that they face. 

How people are able to survive or 
earn will depend upon the land that 
they cultivate. Many depend on these 
lands for work as labourers. Most 
farmers grow crops both for their own 
requirements and also to sell in the 
market. Some have to sell to traders 
from whom they have borrowed 
money. For their survival, many 
families need to borrow money for 
their work or when no work is 
available. There are some families in 
rural areas which thrive on large acres 
of lands, business and other activities. 
However, most small farmers, 
agricultural labourers, fishing 
families, crafts persons in the village 
do not find enough work to keep them 
employed throughout the year.

Urban Livelihoods / 77 

There are more than five thousand towns and twenty seven big cities in 
India. Big cities like Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata etc. have more 
than a million people living and working here. They say that 'the city 
never sleeps!' Let's visit one and find out about the work people do in 
the city. Are they employed by someone or are they self-employed? How 
do they organise themselves? And do they have similar employment 
and earning opportunities? 

Working on the Street 


T 
T 
his is the city where my cousin 
lives. I've been here only a few 
times. It is very big. Once, when I came 
here, my cousin took me around. We 
left the house early in the morning. As 

we turned the corner onto the main 
street we saw that it was already 
buzzing with activity. The vegetable 
vendor was busy arranging tomatoes, 
carrots and cucumbers in baskets at 
her stall so that people could see what 



78 / Social and Political Life 

she had to sell. Next to her stall was a 
lovely, colourful one that sold all kinds 
of flowers. 

We bought a red rose and a yellow 
rose. On the pavement opposite we 
saw a person selling newspapers with 
a small crowd of people around him. 
Everyone wanted to read the news! 
Buses whizzed past and there 

were auto-rickshaws filled 
with school-children. Nearby, 
under a tree, a cobbler sat 
taking his tools and materials 
out of a small tin box. Next to 
him the roadside barber had 
begun his work: he already 
had a customer who wanted 
an early-morning shave! 

A little way down the 
road, a woman was pushing 
along a cart with all kinds of 
plastic bottles, boxes, 
hairpins, clips etc. in it while 

another person on a cycle trolley was 
carrying vegetables to sell to people in 
their houses. 

We came to a place where 
rickshaws were standing in a row 
waiting for customers. We decided to 
take one to the market, which was 
about two kilometres down the road. 


Bachchu Manjhi – A Cycle-Rickshaw 
Puller 
I come from a village in Bihar where I 
worked as a mason. My wife and three 
children live in the village. We don't own 
land. In the village I did not get masonry 
work regularly. The income that I earned 
was not sufficient for our family. 
After I reached this city, I bought an old 
cycle rickshaw and paid for it in 
instalments. This was many years ago. 
I come to the bus stop every morning and 
take the customers wherever they want to 
go. I work till 8.30 in the evening. I take 
rides of up to 6 kilometres in the 
surrounding area. Each customer gives 
me Rs. 5-10 per trip depending on the 
distance. When I'm ill I can't do this work, 
so on those days I don't earn anything. 
I stay with my friends in a rented room. 
They work in a nearby factory. I earn 
between Rs. 80-100 every day, out of 
which I spend Rs. 50-60 on food and rent. 
The rest I save for my family. I visit my 
village two or three times a year to see my 
family. Though my family survives on the 
money I send, my wife also earns from 
agricultural work that she gets once in 
a while.

work. Why?

4. Bachchu Manjhi has to think 
twice before taking a day off from 
work. Why? 
Like Bachchu Manjhi a large 
number of people in the city work on 
the streets. In a survey of Ahmedabad 
city it was found that 12 per cent of all 
the workers in the 
city were people 
working on the street. 
They sometimes sell 
things or repair them 
or provide a service. 

They work on their 
own. They are not 
employed by anyone 
and therefore have to 
organise their own 
work. They have to 
plan how much to 
purchase, as well as 
where and how to set 
up their shops. Their 
shops are usually 
temporary structures: 
sometimes just some 
boards or papers 
spread over discarded 
boxes or maybe a 
canvas sheet hung up 

Urban Livelihoods / 79 
on a few poles. They may also use 
their own carts or simply a plastic 
sheet spread on the pavement. They 
can be asked to dismantle their shops 
at any time by the police. They have no 
security. There are certain parts of the 
city where these hawkers are not 
allowed to enter. 

Vendors sell things that are often 
prepared at home by their families 
who purchase, clean, sort and make 
them ready to sell. For example, those 
who sell food or snacks on the street, 
prepare most of these at home. 

Often workers who make a living in the city are forced to set up their 
homes on the street as well. Below is a space where several workers 
leave their belongings during the day and cook their meals at night. 



80 / Social and Political Life 

There are almost one crore 'street 
vendors' in the country working in 
urban areas. Street vending was till 
recently looked upon only as an 
obstruction to traffic and to people 
walking. However with the effort of many 
organisations it is now recognised as a 
general benefit and as a right of people to 
earn their livelihood. The government is 
thinking about modifying the law that 
banned street vendors, so that they have 
a place to work and that there is also a 
free flow of traffic and people. Hawking 
zones have been suggested for towns 
and cities. It has also been suggested 
that mobile vendors should be allowed to 
move around freely. Hawkers need to be 
part of committees that are set up to 
take these and other decisions relating 
to them. 

In the Market 

When we reached the market the shops 
were just beginning to open. But the 
place was already crowded because of 
the festival season. There were rows 
and rows of shops selling sweets, toys, 
clothes, footwear, utensils, electronic 
goods, etc. There was a dentist's clinic 
also at one end. 

My cousin had an appointment with 
the dentist. We went there first so that 
we would not miss our turn. We had to 
wait for a while in a room before she 
was called inside. The dentist 
examined her and asked her to come 
back the following day to get a cavity in 
her tooth filled. My cousin was scared 
because she thought the process would 
be painful and was upset that she had 
allowed her teeth to go bad. 


From the dental clinic she took me to 
a new garment showroom because I 
wanted to buy some readymade 
clothes. The showroom had three-
floors. Each floor had different types of 
clothes. We went to the third floor 
where clothes for girls were kept. 

Harpreet and Vandana: 
Businesspersons 

My father and uncle worked in a small 
shop. During festival times and on 
Sundays my mother and I helped them 
in the shop. I started working there 
only after I completed my college. 
(Harpreet) 

We opened this showroom some 
years ago. I'm a dress designer. Our 
business has changed. These days 
people prefer to buy readymade 
clothes, rather than have them stitched. 
The trend these days is for readymade 
garments. You also need an attractive 
display for them. (Vandana) 

For our showroom, we buy things 
from different places. We buy most of 



the materials from Mumbai, Ahmeda-
bad, Ludhiana and Tripura. Some 
materials also come from Noida and 
Gurgaon, towns near Delhi. We get 
some dress items from foreign 
countries, too. 

There are several things we need to 
do to run this showroom properly. We 
advertise in various newspapers, 
cinema theatres, television and radio 
channels. Currently, this building is 
rented but soon, we plan to buy it. Ever 
since this market has become the main 
market for people living in the 
surrounding apartments our business 
has grown. We've been able to buy a 
car and book a flat in an apartment 
complex nearby. 

Why did Harpreet and Vandana 
start a showroom? What do they 
have to do to run the showroom? 
Talk to a shop owner in a market 
and find out how he plans his work. 
Have there been any changes in his 
business in the past twenty years? 
What are the differences between 
those who sell on the street and 
those in the market? 
Like Harpreet and Vandana there 
are many people who own shops in 
various markets of the city. These 
shops may be small or large and they 
sell different things. Most businesspersons 
manage their own shops or 
business. They are not employed by 
anyone. But, they do employ a 
number of other workers as 
supervisors and helpers. These are 
permanent shops that are given a 

Urban Livelihoods / 81 
licence to do business by the 
municipal corporation. The Municipal 
Corporation also decides on which day 
of the week the market has to remain 
closed. For example the shops in the 
above market are closed on 
Wednesdays. This market also has 
small offices and shops that provide 
services, such as banks, courier 
services and others. 

In the Factory-Workshop Area 

I wanted to have zari work done on one 
of my dresses which I needed for a 
special occasion. My cousin said that 
she knew Nirmala who works in a 
garment factory. Nirmala's neighbours 
do zari work and embroidery. So we 
caught a bus and headed towards the 
factory area. The bus was really 
crowded. At every stop more and more 
people got on and hardly anyone 
seemed to get off. People were pushing 
others to make more space for 
themselves. My cousin guided me to a 
corner so that we wouldn't get 
squashed. I wondered how people 
travel like this every day. As the bus 
entered the factory area people started 
getting off. We also got off soon at a 
crossing. What a relief that was! 

There were a large number of people 
sitting on railings or in groups at the 
crossing. They seemed to be waiting for 
someone. Some groups had people on 
scooters standing by and talking with 
them. My cousin explained that this 
place was called "labour chowk". These 
were daily wage labourers who work 
as helpers to masons. They dig at 
construction sites, lift loads or unload 



82 / Social and Political Life 

At labour chowk, daily wage workers wait with their tools 
for people to come and take them for work. 


trucks in the market, dig pipelines and 
telephone cables and also build roads. 
There are thousands of such casual 
workers in the city. 

We entered the factory area to find it 
full of small workshops. There seemed 
to be endless rows of them. In one 
section we saw people working in a 

small room on sewing 
machines where cloth was 
being stitched. One person 
operated one sewing 
machine. Clothes that had 
been stitched were stacked 
on one side of the room. 

We located Nirmala in 
the stitching unit. She was 
happy to meet my cousin 
and promised to get zari 
work done on my dress. 

Nirmala works as a 
tailor in an export garment 
unit. The factory where 
she works makes summer 

clothes for people in foreign 

countries like U.S.A., U.K., 

Germany and Netherlands. 

Workers like Nirmala have to 

work very long hours in the 

months from December to 

April. A normal working day 

begins at 9 a.m. and finishes 

only by 10 p.m., sometimes 

even later. She works for six 

days a week. At times when 

the work needs to be done 

urgently, she works on 

Sundays, too. Nirmala is paid 

Rs 80 a day for eight hours 

and Rs 40 extra for working 

late. By June the work is over 
and the factory reduces its staff. 
Nirmala will also be asked to leave. For 
about three or four months in the year, 
there is no work for her. 

Most workers, like Nirmala, are 
employed on what is known as a 
casual basis i.e. they're required to 



Urban Livelihoods / 83 

come as and when the 
employer needs them. 
They are employed when 
the employer gets large 
orders or during certain 
seasons. At other times 
of the year they have to 
find some other work. 

Jobs like Nirmala's are 
not permanent. If workers 
complain about their pay 
or working conditions 
they are asked to leave. 
There is no job security or 

protection if there is ill 
treatment. They are also 
expected to work very long hours. 
For example in the cloth mill units 
the workers work on day and night 
shifts, with each shift lasting 12 
hours. One worker works on one 
machine for 12 hours and then is 
replaced by another on the same 
machine for the next 12 hours. 

1. Why do you think small 
workshops and factories 
employ casual workers? 
2. Describe the working 
conditions of people like 
Nirmala keeping in mind the 
following: working hours, 
conditions in the workplace, 
earnings, and the days of 
work available. 
3. Would you say that 
domestic workers like 
housemaids are also casual 
workers? Why? Describe the 
workday of one such woman 
detailing the work she does 
in other peoples' houses. 
Working in Call Centres is a new form of employment in 
the big cities. A Call Centre is a centralised office that 
deals with problems and questions that consumers/ 
customers have regarding goods purchased and services 
like banking, ticket booking, etc. Call Centres are 
generally set up as large rooms with work stations that 
include a computer, a telephone set and supervisor's 
stations. India has become a major centre not only for 
Indian companies but also foreign companies. They set 
up Call Centres here as they can get people who can 
speak English and will work for lower wages. 

In the office area 

My aunt, Sudha works as a Marketing 

Manager. She had asked us to reach her office 

before 5.30 p.m. We thought we'd get late so 

we took an autorickshaw that managed to get 

us there just in time. Her office was in an area 

surrounded by tall buildings. There were 

hundreds of people coming out. Some headed 

for the car park while others went towards 

the row of buses. 

My aunt is a marketing manager in a 

company which manufactures biscuits. The 

factory where the biscuits are made is 

outside the city. She supervises the work of 

50 salespersons who travel to different parts

of the city. They get orders from 
shopkeepers and collect payments from 
them. She has divided the city into six 
regions and once a week she meets the 
salespersons of each region. She 
checks their progress report and 
discusses problems they face. She has 
to plan the sales in the entire city and 
often has to work late and travel to 
different places. 

She gets a regular salary every 
month and is a permanent worker with 
the company. She can expect her job to 
continue for a long period of time. Being 
a permanent worker she also gets 
other benefits such as the following: 

Savings for old age: A part of her 
salary is kept in a fund with the 
government. She will earn interest on 
these savings. When she retires from 
this job she will get this money and 
she can then live on that. 

Holidays: She gets off on Sundays 
and national holidays. She also gets 
some days as annual leave. 

Medical facilities for her family: Her 
company pays the medical expenses up 
to a certain amount for her and her 
family members. She gets medical 
leave if she falls ill and her salary is 
not cut if she takes this leave. 

There are many workers in the city 
who work in offices, factories, and 
government departments where they 
are employed as regular and 
permanent workers. 

They attend the same office or 
factory regularly. Their work is clearly 
identified. They get a regular salary. 
Unlike casual workers they will not be 
asked to leave if the factory does not 
have much work. 

At the end of the day we got into my 
aunt's car, exhausted. But it had been 
so much fun! And I thought, how 
interesting that so many people do so 
many different things in the city. 
They've probably never met each other 
but it is their work that ties them 
together and helps to make up city life. 

QUESTIONS 

1. Read and discuss the following description of the living conditions of 
workers who come to the labour chowk. 
Most workers that we find at the labour chowk cannot afford permanent 
accommodation and so sleep on pavements near the chowk, or they pay 
Rs 6 a night for a bed at a nearby night shelter run by the Municipal 
Corporation. To compensate for the lack of security, local tea and 
cigarette shops function as banks, moneylenders and safety lockers, all 
rolled into one. Most workers leave their tools at these shops for the night 
for safekeeping, and pass on any extra money to them. The shopkeepers 
keep the money safely and also offer loans to labourers in need.
