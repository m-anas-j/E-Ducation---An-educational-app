Chapter 2 

Diversity and 
Discrimination 

In the previous chapter you have discussed the 
meanings of diversity. Sometimes people who are 
'different' from others are teased, laughed at or not 
included in a certain activity or group. We feel 
hurt, angry, helpless or sad when friends or others 
treat us in such ways. Have you ever wondered 
why this happens? 

In this chapter we will try and explore how such 
experiences are related to the society we live in. 
We will look at how they are connected to the 
inequalities that exist around us. 


Difference and Prejudice 

here are many things that make T us what we are – how we live, the 

languages we speak, what we eat, 
wear, the games we play and the 
things we celebrate. All of these are 
influenced both by the geography and 
history of the place where we live. 

You will get an idea of how diverse 
India is if you look even briefly at the 
following statement: 

There are eight major religions in the 
world. Every single one of them is 
practised in India. We have more than 

1600 languages that are people's 
mother tongues, and there are more 
than a hundred dance forms. 

Yet this diversity is not always 
celebrated. We feel safe and secure 
with people who look, talk, dress and 
think like us. 

Sometimes when we meet people 
who are very different from us we may 
find them strange and unfamiliar. At 
times we may not understand or know 
the reasons why they are different 
from us. People also form certain 
attitudes and opinions about others 
who are not like them. 



14 / Social and Political Life 

Below are some statements on 
people living in rural and urban areas. 
Tick mark those that you agree with: 

On Rural People 
More than 50% of all Indians 
live in villages. 
Villagers do not care about 
their health. They are full of 
superstition. 
People in villages are backward 
and lazy. They do not like to 
work. 
In peak harvesting and planta-
tion season, families spend 12 
to 14 hours working in the 
fields. 
Villagers are dirty and not 
hygienic. 
On Urban People 
Life in the city is easy. People 
here are spoilt and lazy. 
In cities families spend very 
little time with each other. 
People in towns only care about 
money, not about people. 
Living in a city is expensive. A 
large part of people's earnings 
is spent on rent and transport. 
City people cannot be trusted, 
they are cunning and corrupt. 
Some of the statements above see 
villagers as dirty, ignorant and 
superstitious, and see people in cities 
as money-minded, lazy and cunning. 

When our opinions about certain 
people are always negative – seeing 
them as lazy, cunning, stingy – as 
some of the statements above, then 
these become prejudices that we carry 
about them. 

Prejudice means to judge other 
people negatively or see them as 
inferior. When we think that only one 
particular way is the best and right 
way to do things we often end up not 
respecting others, who may prefer to 
do things differently. For example if 
we think English is the best language 
and other languages are not 
important, we are judging these other 
languages negatively. As a result, we 
might not respect people who speak 
languages other than English. 

We can be prejudiced about many 
things: people's religious beliefs, the 
colour of their skin, the region they 
come from, the accent they speak in, 
the clothes they wear etc. Often, our 
prejudices about others are so strong 
that we don't want to form friendships 
with them. At times, we may even act 
in ways that hurt them. 

Look again at the statements that you 
believed to be true about rural and 
urban life in India. Do you have a 
prejudice against rural or urban 
people? Find out if this is shared by 
others and discuss the reasons why 
people have these prejudices. 

Can you list some of the prejudices 
that you have noticed around you. 
How do they affect the ways in which 
people treat each other?

Creating Stereotypes 

All of us are familiar with gender 
differences. What does it mean to be a 
boy or a girl? Many of you would say, 
"We are born as boys and girls. It is a 
given. What is there to think about?" 
Let's see if this is the case. 

Arrange the statements given below in 
these two sections, according to what 
you think is appropriate for the section. 
They are well behaved. 
They are soft spoken and gentle. 
They are physically strong . 
They are naughty. 
They are good at dance and painting. 
They don't cry. 
They are rowdy. 
They are good at sport. 
They are good at cooking. 
They are emotional.

Now check, with your teacher's help, who has put which statement 
where. Find out and discuss people's reasons for doing this. Are the 
qualities you put in for boys something that boys are born with? 
If we take the statement ''They 
don't cry", you'll see that this is a 
quality that is generally associated 
with boys and men. As babies or 
children when boys fall and hurt 
themselves, their parents and other 
family members often console them by 
saying "Don't cry. You are a boy. Boys 

are brave, they don't cry." As children 
grow up they start believing that boys 
do not cry so that even if a boy feels 
like crying he stops himself from 
doing so. He also believes that crying 
is a sign of weakness. So, even though 
both boys and girls sometimes want to 
cry, especially if they are angry or in

a separate school? Give

pain, as they grow older boys learn or 
teach themselves not to cry. If a 
grown boy cries, then he feels that 
others will either tease him or laugh 
at him, and so he stops himself from 
doing so in front of others. 

This is the way boys are and this is 
how girls are: these are statements we 
hear constantly and accept without 
even thinking, and we start believing 
that each one of us must behave 
accordingly. We fit all boys and all 
girls into an image that society creates 
around us. 

You can take other statements such 
as They are soft and gentle or 
They are well behaved and discuss 
how these are applied to girls. Do 
girls possess these qualities at birth 
or do they learn such behaviour 
from others? What do you think 
about girls who are not soft and 
gentle and those who are naughty? 
When we fix people into one image 
we create a stereotype. When people 
say that those who belong to a 
particular country, religion, sex, race 
or economic background are "stingy" 
"lazy," "criminal" or "dumb," they are 
using stereotypes. There are stingy 
and generous people everywhere, in 
every country, in every religion, in 
every group whether rich or poor, 
male or female. And just because 
some people are like that it is not fair 
to think that everyone will be the 
same. 

Stereotypes stop us from looking at 
each person as a unique individual 
with his or her own special qualities 
and skills that are different from

others. They fit large numbers of 
people into only one pattern or type. 
Stereotypes affect all of us as they 
prevent us from doing certain things, 
that we might otherwise be good at. 

Inequality and Discrimination 

Discrimination happens when people 
act on their prejudices or stereotypes. 
If you do something to put other 
people down, if you stop them from 
taking part in certain activities and 
taking up jobs, or stop them from 
living in certain neighbour-hoods, 
prevent them from taking water from 
the same well or hand pump, or not 
allow them to drink tea in the same 
cups or glasses as others, you are 
discriminating against them. 

Discrimination can take place 
because of several reasons. You 
probably recall from the previous 
chapter that Samir Ek and Samir Do 
were different from each other in 
many ways. For example, they 
belonged to different religions. This is 
an aspect of diversity. However, this 
diversity can also be a source of 
discrimination. Groups of people who 
may speak a certain language, follow 
a particular religion, live in specific 
regions etc., may be discriminated 
against as their customs or practices 
may be seen as inferior. 

Another difference between the two 
Samirs was in their economic 
backgrounds. Samir Do was poor. 
This difference, as you have read 
earlier, is not a form of diversity but of 
inequality. People who are poor do 
not have the resources or the money 



18 / Social and Political Life 


A common stereotype about Muslims is 
that they are not interested in 
educating girls and therefore do not 
send girls to school. However, studies 
have now shown that poverty amongst 
Muslims is an important reason why 
Muslim girls do not attend school or 
leave school after a few years. 
Wherever, effort has been made to 
reach education to the poor, there the 
Muslim community has shown an 
interest in sending their girls to school. 
For example in the state of Kerala the 
distance between the school and the 
home is not much. There is a good 
government bus service that helps 
teachers reach schools in rural areas 
and over sixty per cent of the teachers 
are women. These factors have helped 
children from poorer families, 
including Muslim girls, attend school 
in much larger numbers. 
In other states, where such efforts have 
not been made children from poorer 
families whether Muslim, tribal or so-
called lower castes find it difficult to 
attend school. Therefore, poverty not 
religion is the cause for non-attendance 
of Muslim girls in school. 
to meet their basic needs 

of food, clothing and 

shelter. They experience 

discrimination in offices, in 

hospitals, schools etc., 

where they are treated 

badly because they are 

poor. 

Some people may 

experience both kinds of dis


crimination. They are poor 

and they belong to groups 

whose culture is not valued. 

Tribals, some religious 

groups and even particular 

regions, are discriminated 
against for one or more of these 
reasons. In the following section we will 
look at how a famous Indian was 
discriminated against. This will help us 
understand the ways in which caste 
was used to discriminate against large 
numbers of people. 

On being discriminated against 

People are engaged in different kinds 
of work like teaching, carpentry, 
pottery, weaving, fishing, farming etc. 
to earn a livelihood. However, certain 
kinds of work are valued more than 
others. Activities like cleaning, washing, 
cutting hair, picking garbage, are 
seen as tasks that are of less value 
and people who do this work are seen 
as dirty or impure. This belief is an 
important aspect of the caste system. 
In the caste system, communities/ 
groups of people were placed in a sort 
of ladder where each caste was either 
above or below the other. Those who 
placed themselves at the top of 
this ladder called themselves upper 



Dalit is a term that 
people belonging to so-
called lower castes use 
to address themselves. 
They prefer this word 
to 'untouchable'. Dalit 
means those who have 
been 'broken'. This 
word according to 
Dalits shows how 
social prejudices and 
discrimination have 
'broken' the Dalit 
people. The govern-
ment refers to this 
group of people as 
Scheduled Castes (SC).

caste and saw 
themselves as 
superior. The 
groups who 
were placed 
at the bottom 
of the ladder 
were seen as 
unworthy and 
called "untouchables". 


Caste rules 
were set which 
did not allow 
the so-called 
"untouchable" 
to take on work, other than what they 
were meant to do. For example, some 
groups were only allowed to pick 
garbage and remove dead animals 
from the village. But they were not 
allowed to enter the homes of the 
upper castes or take water from the 
village well, or even enter temples. 
Their children could not sit next to 
children of other castes in school. 

Being made to sit seperately in the classroom 
because of one's background is a form of 
discrimination. 

Diversity and Discrimination / 19 

What is the difference between 
discrimination and stereotypes? 
How do you think a person who is 
discriminated against might feel? 
Thus upper castes acted in ways, 
which did not give the so-called 
"untouchables" the same rights as 
they enjoyed. 

Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar, one of the 
great leaders of India, shares his first 
experience of caste-based discrimination, 
which took place in 1901 
when he was just nine years old. He 
had gone with his brothers and 
cousins to meet his father in Koregaon 
which is now in Maharashtra. 

Long did we wait, but no one turned 
up. An hour elapsed and the stationmaster 
came to enquire. He asked us 
for our tickets. We showed them to him. 
He asked us why we tarried. We told 
him that we were bound for Koregaon 
and that we were waiting for father or 
his servant to come, but that neither 
had turned up and that we did not 
know how to reach Koregaon. 

We were well-dressed children. 
From our dress or talk no one could 
make out that we were children of the 
untouchables. Indeed the stationmaster 
was quite sure we were 
Brahmin children and was extremely 
touched at the plight in which he found 
us. As is usual among the Hindus, the 
stationmaster asked us who we were. 
Without a moment's thought I blurted 
out that we were Mahars. (Mahar is 
one of the communities which are 
treated as untouchables in the Bombay

Presidency.) He was stunned. His face 
underwent a sudden change. We could 
see that he was overpowered by a 
strange feeling of repulsion. As soon as 
he heard my reply, he went away to his 
room and we stood where we were. 
Fifteen to twenty minutes elapsed; the 
sun was almost setting. Our father had 
not turned up nor had he sent his 
servant, and now the stationmaster had 
also left us. We were quite bewildered, 
and the joy and happiness, which we felt 
at the beginning of the journey, gave way 
to a feeling of extreme sadness. 

After half an hour the stationmaster 
returned and asked us what we proposed 
to do. We said that if we could get a 
bullock-cart on hire we would go to 
Koregaon, and if it was not very far we 
would like to start straightway. There 
were many bullock-carts plying for hire. 
But my reply to the station master that we 
were Mahars had gone round among the 
cart men and not one of them was 
prepared to suffer being polluted and to 
demean himself carrying passengers of 
the untouchable classes. We were 
prepared to pay double the fare but we 
found that money did not work. The 

Dr Bhim Rao Ambedkar (1891-1956) 
is considered the father of the 
Indian Constitution and is also the 
best known leader of the Dalits. 
Dr Ambedkar fought for the rights 
of the Dalit community. He was 
born into the Mahar caste, which 
was considered untouchable. The 
Mahars were poor, owned no land 
and children born to them also had 
to do the work their parents did. 
They lived in spaces outside the 
main village and were not allowed 
into the village. 
Dr Ambedkar was the first person 
from his caste who completed his 
college education and went to 
England to become a lawyer. He 
encouraged Dalits to send their 
children to school and college. He 
also urged Dalits to take on different 
kinds of government jobs in order to 
move out of the caste system. He led 
many efforts of Dalits to gain entry 
into temples. Later in life he 
converted to Buddhism in his search 
for a religion that treated 
all members equally. 
Dr Ambedkar believed 
that Dalits must 
fight the caste 
system and work 
towards a society 
based on respect not 
just for a few but for 
all persons.

Despite the children 
offering money the cartmen 
refused them. Why? 
How did people at 
the station discriminate 
against Dr Ambedkar and 
his brothers? 
How do you think 
Dr Ambedkar felt as a 
child, when he saw the 
stationmaster's reaction to 
his statement that they 
were Mahars? 
Have you ever experienced 
prejudice or witnessed an 
incident of discrimination? 
How did this make you feel?

Imagine how difficult it would be if 
people could not move easily from one 
place to the other, how insulting and 
hurtful it is to have people move away, 
refuse to touch you or allow you to 
drink water from the same source as 
they do. 

This small incident shows how a 
simple task of going from one place to 
another in a cart was not available to 
the children – even though they could 
pay the money. All the cart men at the 
station refused to take the children. 
They acted in a discriminatory 
manner. 

So, clearly, as this story shows us, 
caste based discrimination is not only 
limited to preventing Dalits from 
undertaking certain economic 
activities but it also denies them the 
respect and dignity given to others. 

Diversity and Discrimination / 21 

Discuss 

In addition to the lower castes 
being discriminated against, there 
are also various other communities 
that are subject to discrimination. 

Can you think of a few other 
examples of discrimination. 

Discuss the ways in which persons 
with special needs might be 
subject to discrimination. 

Striving for Equality 

The struggle for freedom from British 
rule also included within it the 
struggle of large groups of people who 
not only fought against the British but 
also fought to be treated more equally. 
Dalits, women, tribals and peasants 
fought against the inequalities they 
experienced in their lives. 

As pointed out earlier, many Dalits 
organised themselves to gain entry 
into temples. Women demanded that 
they should have as much a right to 
education as men did. Peasants and 
tribals fought to release themselves 
from the grasp of the moneylender 
and the high interest they were 
charged. 

When India became a nation in 
1947 our leaders too were concerned 
about the different kinds of 
inequalities that existed. Those who 
wrote the Constitution of India, a 
document that laid out the rules by 
which the nation would function, 
were aware of the ways in which 



22 / Social and Political Life 

Women at a rally demanding their rights 


discrimination had been practised 

in our society and how people 
had struggled against this. Many 
leaders of these struggles such as 
Dr Ambedkar had also fought for the 
rights of the Dalits. 

So these leaders set out a vision 
and goals in the Constitution to 
ensure that all the people of India 
were considered equal. This equality 
of all persons is seen as a key value 
that unites us all as Indians. 
Everyone has equal rights and 
opportunities. Untouchability is seen 

as a crime and has been legally 
abolished by law. People are free 
to choose the kind of work they 
wish to do. Government jobs 
are open to all people. In addition, 
the Constitution also placed 
responsibility on the government 
to take specific steps to realise this 
right to equality for poor and other 
such marginal communities. 

The writers of the Constitution 
also said that respect for diversity 
was a significant element in 
ensuring equality. They felt that 
people must have the freedom to 
follow their religion, speak their 
language, celebrate their festivals 
and express themselves freely. 
They said that no one language, 
religion or festival should become 
compulsory for all to follow. They 
said that the government must 
treat all religions equally. 

Therefore, India became a 

secular country where people of 

different religions and faiths have 

Some of the members who wrote the 
Constitution of India. 



Diversity and Discrimination / 23 
the freedom to practise and follow 
their religion without any fear of 
discrimination. This is seen as an 
important element of our unity – that 
we all live together and respect one 
other. 

Though these ideals are enshrined 
in our Constitution, this chapter 
points out that inequalities exist even 
today. Equality is a value that we 
have to keep striving for and not 
something which will happen 
automatically. People's struggles and 
positive actions by the government 
are necessary to make this a reality 
for all Indians. 

QUESTIONS 

1. Match the following statements in a way that challenges stereotypes. 
The first page of the Constitution that clearly 
states that all Indians are entitled to equality of 
status and opportunity. 


a. Two surgeons were sitting down to 
lunch when one of them made a call on 
the mobile phone 
b. The boy who won the drawing 
competition went to the dias 
c. One of the fastest athletes in the 
world 
d. She was not that well-off but had a 
dream 
1. suffers from chronic asthma. 
2. to become an astronaut which she 
did. 
3. to speak with her daughter who had 
just returned from school. 
4. on a wheelchair to collect his prize.

2. How can the stereotype that girls are a burden on their parents affect 
the life of a daughter? Imagine this situation and list at least five 
different effects that this stereotype can have on the way daughters 
get treated in the house. 
3. What does the Constitution say with regard to equality? Why do you 
think it is important for all people to be equal? 
4. Sometimes people make prejudiced comments in our presence. We are 
often not in a position to do anything about this because it is difficult 
to say something right then and there. Divide the class into groups 
and each group discuss what they could do in one of the following 
situations: 
a. A friend begins to tease a classmate because he is poor. 
b. You are watching TV with your family and one of them 
makes a prejudicial comment about a particular 
religious community. 
c. Children in your class refuse to share their food with a 
particular person because they think she is dirty. 
d. Someone tells you a joke that makes fun of a community 
because of their accent. 
e. Some boys make remarks about girls not being able to 
play games as well as them. 
Discuss in class what the different groups have suggested for the 
above situations, and also talk about the problems that can come up 
when raising the issue.
