Key Elements of 
a Democratic 
Government 

In this chapter you will read about some of 
the key elements that influence the working 
of a democratic government. These include 
people's participation, the resolution of 
conflict and equality and justice. 

He had been shot by the police. Maya 
was shocked. "Why?" she asked. 
South Africa 
India 
S
outh Africa is a country that has 
people of several races. There are 

black people who belong to South 
Africa, whites who came there to settle, 
and Indians who came as labourers 
and traders. 

Maya Naidoo, an eleven-year old 
South African girl living in the town of 
Johannesburg, was helping her mother 
clear up her old boxes. She found a 
scrapbook full of pictures and 
newspaper articles. There were many 
pictures of a young schoolboy of around 
fifteen years of age. When she asked 
her mother who the boy was, she was 
told that he was called, Hector Ndlovu. 

Her mother explained that South 
Africa was earlier governed by 
apartheid laws. Apartheid means 
separation on the basis of race. South 
African people were divided into white, 
black, Indian and coloured races. 
According to the law, these races were 
not allowed to mingle with each other, to 
live near each other or even to use 
common facilities. 

Maya could not believe her ears. 
Maya's mother sounded angry when 
she spoke about life under apartheid. 
She told Maya that in those days

hospitals were separate and so were 
ambulances. An ambulance meant for 
white people would always be well 
equipped while one meant for black 
people was not. There were separate 
trains and buses. Even the busstops 
were different for black and white 
people. 

Non-whites were not allowed to 
vote. The best land in the country was 
reserved for the white people, and nonwhites 
had to live on the worst 
available land. Thus blacks and 
coloured people were not considered to 
be equal to whites. 

One black township was the south 
western township or Soweto. Hector 
Ndlovu lived here and he and his 
classmates joined the protest against 
learning the Afrikaans language in 
school. This was the language that the 

whites spoke. Hector and other school 
students were being forced to learn 
this language but they wanted to learn 
their own language, Zulu. The South 
African police beat up the protestors 
mercilessly and shot at the crowd. 
One of their bullets killed Hector. This 
was on 30th of April,1976. 

The African National Congress, a 
group of people who led the struggle 
against apartheid, and their most well 
known leader, Nelson Mandela fought 
the apartheid system for several 
years. Finally, they succeeded and in 
1994 South Africa became a 
democratic country in which people of 
all races were considered equal. 

What were Hector and his classmates 

protesting about?

Do you think it is important for all 

persons to be treated equally? Why? 

Let us now try to understand what 
a democratic government means to all 
of us. 

PARTICIPATION 

Why do we have regular elections? 
You've already read in the previous 
chapter that people make the 
decisions in a democracy. Through 
voting in elections people elect leaders 
to represent them. These representatives 
take decisions on behalf of the

the tiger population in India is 
falling. Tigers are being 


hunted and killed by poachers 
for their skins. The 
government has not taken the 
issue of poaching seriously 
enough. It must take action 
immediately, arrest the 
poachers and implement the 
laws protecting the tiger. If 
this does not happen the tiger 
will become an extinct animal 
in the next ten years.

people. In doing so it is assumed that 
they will keep in mind the voices and 
interests of the people. 

Discuss 

Look at some newspapers and 
discuss some elections that you 
may have read about. Why do 
you think elections are required 
after a fixed period? 

All governments are elected for fixed 
periods. In India this period is five years. 
Once elected, governments can stay in 
power only for that period. If they want 
to continue to be in power then they 
have to be re-elected by the people. This 
is a moment when people can sense 
their power in a democracy. In this way 
the power of the government gets 
limited by regular elections. 

Not bad! One of the taps in the nearby 
village must be getting water!

Other ways of participating 

Elections are usually held once in five 
years. Besides voting there are other 
ways of participating in the process of 
government. People participate by 
taking an interest in the working of 
the government and by criticising it 
when required. In August 2005, when 
a particular government increased the 
money people had to pay for 
electricity, people expressed their 
disapproval very sharply. They took 
out rallies and also organised a 
signature campaign. The government 
tried to explain and defend its 
decision but finally listened to the 
people's opinion and withdrew the 
increase. The government had to 
change its decision because it is 
responsible to the people. 

Take Action 


38 / Social and Political Life 
There are many ways in which 
people express their views and make 
governments understand what 
actions they should take. These 
include dharnas, rallies, strikes, 
signature campaigns etc. Things that 
are unfair and unjust are also 
brought forward. Newspapers, 
magazines and TV also play a role in 
discussing government issues and 
responsibilities. 


While it is true that a democracy 
allows people to participate, it is also 
true that not all sections of people are 
actually able to do so. Another way for 
people to participate is by organising 
themselves into social movements 
that seek to challenge the government 
and its functioning. Members of the 
minority community, dalits, adivasis, 
women and others are often able to 
participate in this manner. 

If a country's people are alert and 
interested in how the country is run, 
the democratic character of the 
government of that country will be 
stronger. 

So the next time we see a rally 
winding through the streets of our 
cities and towns or villages we should 
pause to find out what the rally is 
about, who is participating in it, and 
what they are protesting about. This 
will help to give us a sense of how our 
government works. 

NEED TO RESOLVE CONFLICT 

In Maya's story you read about how 
conflicts can often lead to violence 
and death because one group decides 
that it is all right to use force to 
prevent the other group from 
protesting. 

Read the story again: Do you 
think the police shooting of 
Hector could have been 
avoided? How? 
Conflicts occur when people of 
different cultures, religions, regions or 
economic backgrounds do not get 
along with each other, or when some 
among them feel they are being 
discriminated against. People may use 
violent means to settle their 
differences. This leads to fear and 
tension among others living in an 
area. The government is responsible 
for helping to resolve conflicts. 

Let's read about some of the 
conflicts in our society and the role of 
the government in resolving them. 



The Indian Constitution lays 
down the basic rules or laws that 
have to be followed by everyone. 
These laws are for both the 
government and the people. 
Conflicts and differences have to 
be resolved according to these 
laws. We will read more about 
this in later classes.

Conflicts and differences have to

this in later classes. 
Religious processions and 
celebrations can sometimes lead to 
conflicts. For example, the route a 
procession takes may lead to a conflict. 
The government, particularly the 
police play an important role in 
getting representatives of concerned 
communities to meet and try and 
arrive at a solution. At times there is 
fear that violence may erupt, with 
people throwing stones or trying to 
disrupt the procession. The police is 
responsible for ensuring that violence 
does not take place. 

Rivers too can become a source of 
conflict between states. A river may 
begin in one place, flow through 

Key Elements of a Democratic Government / 39 
another and end in a third. The 
sharing of river water between 
different places that the river goes 
through is becoming an issue of 
conflict. For example you may have 
heard about the Cauvery water 
dispute between Karnataka and 
Tamil Nadu. The water stored in 
Krishnasagar dam in Karnataka is 
used for irrigating a number of 
districts and for meeting the needs of 
the city of Bangalore. The water stored 
in Mettur dam in Tamil Nadu is used 
for crops grown in the delta region of 
that state. 

A conflict arises because both dams 
are on the same river. The downstream 
dam in Tamil Nadu can only be filled 
up if water is released from the 
upstream one located in Karnataka. 
Therefore, both states can't get as 
much water as they need for people in 
their states. This leads to conflict. The 
central government has to step in and 
see that a fair distribution is worked 
out for both states. 

Quiet flows the Cauvery despite being at the centre of 
heated conflict between two states for the last 30 years.

EQUALITY AND JUSTICE 

One of the key ideas of a democratic 
government is its commitment to 
equality and justice. Equality and 
justice are inseparable. 

Discuss 

In Maya's story did the government 

support the idea that people are 

equal? 

In Dr Ambedkar's story did the 

practice of untouchability support 

the idea that people are equal? 

The earlier practice of untouch-
ability is now banned by law. This 
group of people were denied education, 
transport or medical facilities and 
even the chance to offer prayers. 
Dr Ambedkar, whom you have read 
about earlier in this book, and many 
others like him, realised that such 
practices must not continue and that 
justice can only be achieved when 
people are treated equally. 

QUESTIONS 

The government also recognises 
this and makes special provisions for 
groups within society that are unequal. 
For instance, in our society there is a 
general tendency to value and care for 
the boy child more than the girl child. 

This means that society does not 
value the girl and boy child equally and 
this is unjust. In this context the 
government steps in to promote justice 
by providing special provisions that 
can enable girls to overcome the 
injustice that they are subjected to. 
Thus it is possible that fees for girls 
might be waived or lowered in 
government schools or colleges. 

How do you think lowering the school 
fees would help girls attend school? 
Can you think of any experience from 
your life in which you have helped 
someone out of a situation which you 
thought was unfair? Did everyone else 
see it the same way? What did you 
have to say to convince others that 
what you did was fair? 
1. How would Maya's life be different in South Africa today? 
2. What are the various ways in which people participate in the process 
of government? 
3. Why do you think we need the government to find solutions to many 
disputes or conflicts? 
4. What actions does the government take to ensure that all people are 
treated equally? 
5. Read through the chapter and discuss some of the key ideas of a 
democratic government. Make a list. For example, all people are 
equal.
