Chapter 1 

Understanding 
Diversity 

Look around you in the classroom: do you see 
anyone who looks exactly like you do? In this 
chapter you will learn that people are different from 
each other in many ways. Not only do they look 
different but they might also belong to different 
regional, cultural or religious backgrounds. These 
differences enrich our lives in many ways and also 
make them more fun! 

All these different people, who come from all kinds of 
backgrounds, and belong to all kinds of religions and 
cultures help to make India so interesting and so 
diverse. What does diversity add to our lives? How 
did India become like this? Are all kinds of difference 
a part of diversity? Can diversity also be a part of 
unity? Read this chapter to find some answers.

hree children around your age have drawn 
the figures above. Use the empty box to 
draw your human figure. Is your drawing 
similar to any of the others? The chances are 
that your drawing is quite different from the 
other three, which you can see are quite 
different from each other. This is because each 
one of us has a unique drawing style. We not 
only don't look exactly like each other but also 
differ in terms of the language we speak, our 
cultural backgrounds, the religious rituals we 
observe and, of course the way we draw!

Now ask your teacher to help you 
check, how many of you have similar 
answers. Is there anyone whose list 
matches yours exactly? Probably not. 
But many of you may have similar 
answers. How many like reading the 
same kind of books? How many 
different languages are spoken by the 
students in your class? 

By now you must have recognised 
the many ways in which you are quite 
like some of your classmates and 
other ways in which you are different 
from them. 

Making friends 

Do you think it would be easy for you 
to make friends with someone who 
was very different from you? Read the 
following story and think about this. 

I had meant it as a joke. A joke 
made up for a small ragged boy who 
sold newspapers at the Janpat 
crossing at the busy intersection. 
Every time I cycled past he would run 
after me, holding out the English paper 

and screaming out the evening's 
headlines in a mixture of Hindi and 
English words. This time, I stopped by 
the pavement and asked for the Hindi 
paper. His mouth fell open. 

"You mean you know Hindi?" he 
asked. 

"Of course," I said as I paid for the 
paper. 

"Why? What did you think?" 

He paused. "But you look so…so 
angrez," he said. "You mean you can 
even read Hindi?" 

"Of course I can," I said, this time a 
little impatiently. "I can speak, read 


and write Hindi. Hindi is one of the 
subjects I study in school." 

"Subjects?" he asked. How could I 
explain what a subject was to someone 
who had never been to school? "Well, it 
is something…" I began, but the lights 
changed, and the honking behind me 
grew a hundredfold and I let myself be 
pushed along with the rest of the 
traffic. 



The next day he was there again, 
smiling at me and holding out a Hindi 
paper. "Bhaiyya," he said, "aap ka 
akhbaar. Ab Bathaaiye yeh subject 
kya cheez hai?" the English word 
sounded strange on his tongue. 
It sounded like its other meaning 
in English – to be ruled by someone 
else. 

"Oh, it's just something to study," I 
said. And then because the red light 
had come on, I asked him, "Have you 
ever been to school?" "Never," he 
answered. And he added proudly, "I 
began working when I was so high." 
He measured himself against my 
cycle-seat. "First my mother used to 
come with me but I can do it all alone." 

"Where is your mother now?" I 
asked, but then the lights changed and 
I was off. I heard him yell from 
somewhere behind me, "She's in 
Meerut with…" The rest was drowned 
out. 

"My name is Samir," he said the 
next day. And very shyly he asked, 
"What's yours?" It was incredible. My 
bicycle wobbled. "My name is Samir 
too," I said. "What?" His eyes lit up. 
"Yes," I grinned at him. "It's another 
name for Hanuman's father, you 
know." "So now you are Samir Ek and 
I'm Samir Do," he said triumphantly. 
"Something like that," I answered and 
then I held out my hand. "Haath milao, 
Samir Do!" His hand nestled in mine 
like a little bird. I could still feel its 
warmth as I cycled away. 

Understanding Diversity / 5 

The next day, he did not have his 
usual smile for me. "There is trouble in 
Meerut," he said. "Many people are 
being killed there in the riots." I looked 
at the headlines. Communal Riots, it 
blazed. "But Samir…" I began. "I'm a 
Muslim Samir," he said in answer. 
"And all my people are in Meerut." His 
eyes filled with tears and when I 
touched his shoulder, he would not 
look up. 

He was not at the crossing the day 
after. Neither the day after nor ever 
again. And no newspaper, in English or 
Hindi, can tell me where my Samir do 
has gone. 

(The Lights Changed by Poile Sengupta) 

Name three ways in which Samir 
Ek and Samir Do were different? 
Did these differences prevent 
them from becoming friends? 
While Samir Ek is more familiar 
with English, Samir Do speaks Hindi. 
Although they both are more at home 
in different languages they still 
communicated with each other. They 
made the effort to do so because this 
was what was important to them. 

Samir Ek and Samir Do also come 
from different religious and cultural 
backgrounds. While Samir Ek is a 
Hindu, Samir Do is a Muslim. 
Different religious and cultural 
backgrounds such as these are an 
aspect of diversity. 



6/ Social and Political Life 

Make a list of the festivals that 
might have been celebrated by 
the two boys. 
Samir Ek: 
Samir Do: 
Can you think of a situation in 
which you made friends with 
someone who was very different 
from you? Write a story that 
describes this. 
In addition to their 
diverse religious and 
cultural backgrounds, 
there are other ways 
in which Samir Ek 
and Samir Do are 
different from each 
other. For example, 
while Samir Ek goes to 
school, Samir Do sells 
newspapers. 

Discuss 

Why do you think Samir Do did 
not attend school? Do you think 
it would have been easy for him 
to attend school if he wanted to? 
In your opinion is it a fair 
situation that some children get 
to go to school and others don't? 

Samir Do did not have the 
opportunity to attend school. Perhaps 
you've noticed that there are several 
people in the area where you live who 
are poor and who don't have enough 
to eat or wear and sometimes not even 
a place to live. This difference is not 
the same as the one we have seen 

earlier. Here, we're talking not of 
difference but of inequality. Inequality 
comes about when a person does not 
have the resources and opportunitites 
that are available to other persons. 

The caste system is another 
example of inequality. According to 
this, society was divided into different 
groups depending upon the work that 
people did and they were supposed to 
remain in those groups. So if your 
parents were potters you could only 
become a potter, nothing else. This 
system was considered irreversible. 
And because you were not supposed 
to change your profession, it was not 
considered necessary for you to know 
anything more than what you needed 
in your profession. This created a 
situation of inequality. You will read 
more about this and other inequalities 
in the following chapters. 

What does diversity add to our 
lives? 

Just like Samir Ek and Samir Do 
became friends, you might have 
friends who are very different from 
you. You have probably eaten 
different kinds of food in their homes, 
celebrated different festivals with 
them, tried out the clothes they wear, 
and learnt some of their languages 
as well. 

Make a list of the food that you 
have eaten from different parts of 
India. 
Make a list of the languages besides 
your mother tongue that you can 
speak at least one or two words of. 

You probably like reading and 
hearing stories and adventures about 
different animals, people and even 
ghosts. Perhaps you even enjoy 
making up stories yourself ! Many 
young people feel happy when they 
read a good story because it gives 
them lots of ideas to make up more 
stories. People who write stories get 
their ideas from all sorts of different 
places – from books, and real life and 
from their imagination. 

Some may have lived in forests 
close to animals and chosen to write 
of their fights and friendships. Others 
read real accounts of kings and 
queens and wrote stories about love 
and honour. Some dipped into their 
own childhood memories of school 
and friends and wrote stories of 
adventure.

place where all people wore 
the same two colours red and 
white, ate the same food 
(maybe potatoes!), took care 
of the same two animals, 
for example, the deer and

themselves played snakes 
and ladders. What kind of 
stories do you think they 
would write?

DIVERSITY IN INDIA 

India is a country of many diversities. 
We speak different lang-uages, have 
various types of food, celebrate 
different festivals, practise different 
religions. But actually, if you think 
about it, we do many things that are 
similar except that we do them in 
different ways. 

How do we explain Diversity? 

A little more than two hundred years 
ago or long before the train, 
aeroplane, bus or car became a part of 
our lives, people travelled from one 
part of the world to another, in ships, 
on horses or camels or on foot.

List at least three different ways in which people in India do the following. 
One of the possible answers has been provided for you already. 

Different ways in Through singing a 

which people pray hymn 

Different ways in 
which people get 
married 

Different ways in 
which people dress 

Different ways in 
which people greet 
each other 

Different ways in By making Biriyani 
which people cook with meat or 
rice vegetables 

Often, they went in search of new 
lands, or new places to settle in, or for 
people to trade with. And because it 
took so long to travel, once they got to 
a place, people stayed there, often for 
a long time. Many others left their 
homes because there were famines 
and drought and they could not get 
enough to eat. Some went in search of 
work while others left because there 
was a war. 

Sometimes, as they began to make 
their homes in new places, people 
began to change a little and at other 
times they managed to do things in 
the old ways. So their languages, food,

music, religions became a mix of the 
old and the new, and out of this intermixing 
of cultures, came something 
new and different. 

The history of many places shows 
us how many different cultural 
influences have helped to shape life 
and culture there. Thus regions 
became very diverse because of their 
unique histories. 

Similarly diversity also comes 
about when people adapt their lives to 
the geographical area in which they 
live. For example living near the sea is 
quite different from living in a 
mountainous area.

Buddhism reached Tibet via Ladakh. Ladakh is 
also called Little Tibet. Islam was introduced in 
this region more than four hundred years ago 
and there is a significant Muslim population 
here. Ladakh has a very rich oral tradition of 
songs and poems. Local versions of the Tibetan 
national epic the Kesar Saga are performed and 
sung by both Muslims and Buddhists.

Kerala is a state in the south-
west corner of India. It is 
surrounded by the sea on one 
side and hills on the other. A 
number of spices like pepper, 
cloves and cardamoms are grown on the 
hills. It is spices that made this region 
an attractive place for traders. Jewish 
and Arab traders were the first to come 
here. The Apostle of Christ, St. Thomas 
is believed to have come here nearly 
2000 years ago and he is credited with 
bringing Christianity to India. 
Many Arab traders also came and 
settled down here. Ibn Battuta, who 
travelled here a little less than seven 
hundred years ago, wrote a travelogue in 
which he describes the lives of Muslims 
and says that they were a 
highly respected community. The 
Portuguese discovered the sea 
route to India from Europe when 
Vasco da Gama landed with his 
ship here. 
Because of all these various 
historical influences, people in 
Kerala practise different religions 
such as Judaism, Islam, Chris-
tianity, Hinduism and Buddhism. 
The fishing nets used here look 
exactly like the Chinese fishing 
nets and are called cheena-vala. 
Even the utensil used for frying is called 
the cheenachatti, and it is believed that 
the word cheen could have come from 
China. The fertile land and climate are 
suited to growing rice and a majority of 
people here eat rice, fish and 
vegetables. 
The boat race is an important part of 
the Onam festival celebrated in Kerala. 

While Kerala and Ladakh are quite 
different in terms of their 
geographical features, the history of 
both regions has seen similar cultural 
influences. Both regions were 
influenced by Chinese and Arab 
traders. It was the geography of 
Kerala which allowed for the 
cultivation of spices and the special 
geographical location of Ladakh and 
its wool that drew traders to these 
regions. Thus history and geography 
are often tied in the cultural life of a 
region. 

The influence of diverse cultures is 
not merely a thing of the past. Our 
present lives are all about moving 
from place to place for work and with 
each move our cultural traditions and 
way of life slowly becomes part of the 
new place we are in. Similarly in our 
own neighbourhoods we live close to 
people from several communities. Our 
daily lives are about the ways in 
which we do things together and hear 
stories about each other's lives, 
customs and traditions. 

UNITY IN DIVERSITY 

India's diversity has always been 
recognised as a source of its strength. 
When the British ruled India, women 
and men from different cultural, 
religious and regional backgrounds 
came together to oppose them. India's 
freedom movement had thousands of 
people of different backgrounds in it. 
They worked together to decide joint 
actions, they went to jail together, and 
they found different ways to oppose 
the British. Interestingly the British 

Understanding Diversity / 11 
thought they could divide Indians 
because they were so different, and 
then continue to rule them. But the 
people showed how they could be 
different and yet be united in their 
battle against the British. 

Don't forget the days of blood, O friend

O friend 
The blood of Hindus and Muslims flows 

together today 

Do soak your robe in this river of blood

graves 
Do shed a few tears for them O friend. 

Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA) 

This song was sung after the 
Jallianwalla Bagh massacre in 
Amritsar in which a British general 
opened fire on a large group of 
unarmed, peaceful people killing 
many and wounding even more. Men 
and women, Hindus, Sikhs and 
Muslims, rich and poor had gathered 
to protest against the British. This 
song was composed and sung 
to honour the memory of those 
brave people. 



Pt. Nehru delivering an Independence Day speech 


12 / Social and Political Life 
In his book The 
Discovery of India 

Jawaharlal Nehru says 

that Indian unity is not 

something imposed 

from the outside but 

rather, "It was 

something deeper and 

within its fold, the 

widest tolerance of 

belief and custom was 

practised and every 

variety acknowledged 

and even encouraged." 

It was Nehru, who 

coined the phrase, "unity in diversity"

Songs and symbols that emerged 

to describe the country.
during the freedom struggle serve as a 
constant reminder of our country's 
rich tradition of respect for diversity. 
Do you know the story of the Indian 
flag? It was used as a symbol of 
protest against the British by people 
everywhere. 

India's national anthem, 
composed by Rabindranath 
Tagore, is another expression 
of the unity of India. In what 
way does the national 
anthem describe this unity? 
QUESTIONS 

1. Draw up a list of the different festivals celebrated in your locality. 
Which of these celebrations are shared by members of different 
regional and religious communities? 
2. What do you think living in India with its rich heritage of diversity 
adds to your life? 
3. Do you think the term "unity in diversity" is an appropriate term to 
describe India? What do you think Nehru is trying to say about 
Indian unity in the sentence quoted above from his book The 
Discovery of India? 
4. Underline the line in the poem sung after the Jallianwalla massacre, 
which according to you, reflects India's essential unity. 
5. Choose another region in India and do a similar study of the 
historical and geographical factors that influence the diversity found 
there. Are these historical and geographical factors connected to 
each other? How?
