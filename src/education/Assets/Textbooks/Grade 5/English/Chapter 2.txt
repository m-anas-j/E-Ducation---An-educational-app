CHAPTER 2
SUBJECT AND PREDICATE
3. When we make a sentence:
(1) We name some person or thing; and
(2) Say something about that person or thing.
Page 2
In other words, we must have a subject to speak about and we must say or predicate
something about that subject.
Hence every sentence has two parts:
(1) The part which names the person or thing we are speaking about. This is called the
Subject of the sentence.
(2) The part which tells something about the Subject. This is called the Predicate of the
sentence.
4. The Subject of a sentence usually comes first, but occasionally it is put after the
Predicate; as,
Here comes the bus.
Sweet are the uses of adversity.
5. In Imperative sentences the Subject is left out; as,
Sit down. [Here the Subject You is understood].
Thank him. [Here too the Subject You is understood.]
