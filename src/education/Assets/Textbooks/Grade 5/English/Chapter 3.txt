CHAPTER 3
THE PHRASE AMD THE CLAUSE
6. Examine the group of words “in a corner”. It makes sense, but not complete sense.
Such a group of words, which makes sense, but not complete sense, is called a Phrase.
In the following sentences, the groups of words in italics are Phrases:
The sun rises in the east.

It was a sunset of great beauty.
The tops of the mountains were covered with snow.
Show me how to do it.
7. Examine the groups of words in italics in the following sentences:
He has a chain of gold.
He has a chain which is made of gold.
We recognize the first group of words as a Phrase.
The second group of words, unlike the Phrase of gold, contains a Subject (which) and a
Predicate (is made of gold).
Such a group of words which forms part of a sentence, and contains a Subject and a
Predicate, is called a Clause.
In the following sentences, the groups of words in italics are Clauses:
People who pay their debts are trusted.
We cannot start while it is raining.
I think that, you have made a mistake.
