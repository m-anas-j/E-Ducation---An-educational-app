Preface 
Education is the key to development. A progressively improved education system largely 
determines the pace and the quality of national development. To reflect the hopes and 
aspirations of the people and the socio-economic and cultural reality in the context of the 
post independent Bangladesh, new textbooks were introduced in the beginning of the 1980s 
following the recommendations of the National Curriculum and Textbook Committee. 
In 1994, in accordance with the need for change and development, the textbooks of lower 
secondary, secondary and higher secondary were revised and modified. The textbooks from 
classes VI to IX were written in 1995. In 2000, almost all the textbooks were rationally 
evaluated and necessary revision were made. In 2008, the Ministry of Education formed a 
Task Force for Education. According to the advice and guidance of the Task Force, the cover, 
spelling and information in the textbooks were updated and corrected. 
To make assessment more meaningful and in accordance with the need of the curriculum, 
Creative Questions and Multiple Choice Questions are given at the end of each chapter. It is 
hoped that this will reduce the dependency of students on rote memorisation. The students 
will be able to apply the knowledge they have gained to judge, analyses and evaluate real life 
situation. 
The textbook of Secondary Geography has been revised. Unnecessary repetition has been 
avoided. New chapters have been included. Maps have been given so that learners can read 
and learn to use them. In order to make learning of Geography simple and casy, figures and 
pictures are also given. 
This book of Geography for class IX and X is the English Version of the original textbook 
entitled ÔMaydhamic BhagyalÕ written in Bangla. 
We know that curriculum development is a continuous process on which textbooks are 
written. Any logical and formative suggestions for improvement will be considered with care. 
On the event of the golden jubilee of the Independence of Bangladesh in 2021, we want to be 
a part of the ceaseless effort to build a prosperous Bangladesh. 
In spite of sincere efforts in translation, editing 'and printing some inadvertent errors and 
omissions may be found in the book. However, our efforts to make it more refined and 
impeccable will continue. Any constructive suggestion towards its further improvement will 
be gratefully considered. 
I thank those who have assisted us with their intellect and effort in the writing, editing and 
rational evaluation of this book. We hope that the book will be useful for the students for 
whom it is written.

Secondary Geography	 1 
Introduction 
Geography and the Study of Geography 
Man and the earth are the principal constituents of geography. Geography is the 
description of the earth as the dwelling place of human beings. The ancient Greek 
geographer Eratosthenes first used the term ÔGeographyÕ. In Greek, ÔGeo’ means Ôthe 
earthÕ and ÔgraphyÕ means ÔdescriptionÕ. So geography is the description of the earth. 
Richard Hartshone said in 1959 Perspective on the Nature of Geography that 
geography is related to giving a rational and well-arranged account of the changing 
characteristics of the earth’s surface. Professor Mackney said in 1962 that geography 
studies human activities and livelihood in human related physical and social 
environment. Professor Dudley Stamp defined geography to be a study of the earth 
and its inhabitants. Many others have defined geography in different perspectives. You 
will come to learn these in higher classes. 
The Rationale of Studying Geography 
One of the reasons of studying geography as a separate subject in secondary classes is 
that man cannot live in this world without nature and geography is the mother of all 
natural sciences. The study of geography gives us the knowledge of the location of 
hills, mountains, rivers, deserts, plains and plateaus in different places of the earth, the 
cause of their formation and the distinctive features of their formation. 
The scope of geography is so wide, that it is not limited to the study of physical 
elements only. It also examines the process of development of man’s economic life by 
using natural resources. The study of geography is essential to know about different 
agricultural methods and different kinds of crops, the status of industry, commerce 
and communication facilities. The knowledge of geography is also essential to prepare 
economic plans. Geography is divided into different branches. 
The different branches of geography are : 
1. 	Physical geography 
2. 	Economic geography 
3. 	Political geography 
4. 	Mathematical geography 
5. 	Human geography 
6. 	Regional geography 
7. 	Historical geography 
8. 	Plant geography 
9. 	Zoo geography 
The three branches of geography studied at the secondary level are (1) Mathematical 
geography, (2) Physical geography and (3) Regional geography. These three branches 
have been described in the following chapters.
Part One 
Mathematical Geography 
Chapter One 
Luminaries and Solar System 
Luminaries 
The boundless sky is all around our abode, the earth. This vast infinite sky is called 
the firmament or the space. However, the scientists term it as a place where all the 
particles and energy of the universe are concentrated or floating. The space has no 
beginning or end. There are infinite number of luminaries in the firmament. If we 
look at this infinite space, we see the sun at day time and at night we see innumerable 
dots of light including the moon. These luminaries are revolving on their own axis 
with a particular speed in a very disciplined manner. The sun is a star and the moon 
is a satellite. These stars and their planets and satellites are called the luminaries. 
Previously only the bright objects 
found in the space were called the 
luminaries but now the existence of 
many objects that do not give light 
have been discovered. Nowadays 
luminaries include the moon, the sun, 
planets, stars, meteors, comets and 
besides, faded nebulae, pulser, Black 
Dwarf, Black Holes are also included. 
All these have formed the universe. 
Stars : If we look at the blue and 
bright night sky, we see many dots of 
light twinkling. There are many such 
luminaries in the firmament which are 
called the stars (Fig. l). We can see 
only a few thousands of stars with our 
naked eyes. Some of this can be 
seen from earth with the help of powerful telescope. The scientists, with the help of 
powerful telescope have discovered more than 100 crores of such stars. The stars are 
actually burning gaseous mass. Every star has its own light and heat.

Luminaries and Solar System	 3 
On looking from the earth, the stars seem to exist in same plane. The distance of the 
stars from the earth is measured by the velocity of the light. The unit of measurement 
from the earth to the stars or from stars to stars is called light years. Since the sun is 
the near most star, its distance from the earth is about 15 crore kilometres. A ray of 
light from the sun takes 8 minutes 19 seconds to reach the earth. 
The star next to the sun is Proxima Centauri. It is about 38,00,000 crore kilometres 
from the earth. Scientific discoveries have enhanced our knowledge about the stars. 
Some of the stars are round, some are spiral or lineal while some others are shapeless. 
The density of Black Dwarf and Black Hole is very high and their gravitational force 
is also very strong. 
Constellation : Looking at the cloudless sky in a dark night, one can see a number of 
stars clustered together. These are called constellations. The astronomers in the past, 
connecting every individual constellation with imaginary lines and imagining different 
figures, gave them strange names. Of them, the names of Great Bear, Orion, 
Cassiopeia, Little Bear, Canis Major, Eridanus etc. are worth mentioning. 
Galaxies : Billion of stars, dusts and huge pool of vapour have formed clusters of 
luminaries which are called galaxy or the universe of stars. There are innumerable 
galaxies in the space. Galaxies are far apart from each other. The milky way is a small 
part of a galaxy. 
The Milky Way : The cluster of stars that look like a brightly illuminated long 
pathway extending from north to south in the dark sky is called the milky way. A 
milky way is formed of millions of stars, some scientists take it to be a huge circular 
region. Some other scientists consider it to be a coiled up hard nebulae. Looking at the 
clear and cloudless night sky in winter, one would see a long line of translucent and 
radiant lustre of light with a wide vicinity extended north to south. That is known as 
the milky way. Our solar system including the sun is included in one of such a milky 
way. The sun is positioned among billions of stars in this milky way. 
Nebulae : The covering of the dimly lit stars in the space is called the nebulae. They 
are visible with naked eyes or with powerful telescopes. Some of the nebulae are full 
of gaseous bodies. They have strong forms. These are called gaseous nebulae. The 
scientists think that many nebulae are far away from our milky way. One nebulae may 
contain billions of stars. Since the nebulae are billions and billions of light years away 
from the earth, the stars between them cannot be identified separately. The milky way 
is in the same plane with the nebulae. 
Meteors : Sometimes in the cloudless night sky it looks as if a star is running about or 
a star has just dropped off. This event is known as drop off of a star. These are not 
actually stars. They are called meteors. Innumerable physical masses float in the 
space. The gravitional force causes these physical masses rush towards the earth with 
a violent speed. When they come in touch with air, the friction with air makes them 
flare up. Majority of the meteors are small in size.
4	 Secondary Geography 
Comets : Sometimes a kind of luminaries appear in the space. They exist for a short 
period and then disappear. They are called comets. Comets are amazing celestial body. 
They revolve a long way around a star. When they come near the sun, they become 
visible in the form of cloud. Gradually, the bright centre point looms like hair veiled 
in mist. Then comes out as a long steamed tail just like a bright broom. The English 
word comet has been derived from the Greek word ÔKomet’ that means dishevelled 
hair. Comets exist in the solar system. The astronomer, Edmund Halley observed that 
the comets follow the law of gravitation in the space. The comet he discovered is 
known as Halley’s Comet which appears every 75 years. Halley’s comet appeared in 
1759, 1835, 1910 and 1986. 
Planets : Some celestial bodies revolve round the sun as a result of the gravitional 
force. They have no light of their own. All of them rotate round the sun and get light 
and heat from it. They do not twinkle in the sky. These luminaries are called planets. 
The Earth, Mars, Venus, Saturn, Mercury, Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune are the eight 
planets of our solar system. 
Satellites : Some luminaries are caused by the gravitational force to rotate around a 
planet. They are called satellites. They have no light or heat of their own but they get 
light and heat from the sun or stars. The moon is the only satellite of the planet earth. 
Every planet may not have satellite. Mercury and Venus have no satellite. The 
satellites of the Saturn are the highest in number. 
The Solar System 
The huge universe beyond our vision is called the space. The space is so huge that it is 
very difficult for us to conveive it. There are stars, comets, planets, satellites, meteors 
and other heavenly bodies in the space. The universe is formed of these innumerable 
celestial bodies. The sun is considered as a star of the universe. The solar system 
includes the sun, its planets and satellites, billions of meteoroids and thousands of 
comets (Fig. 2). The sun is the centre around which all other members of the solar 
system revolve. All the activities of the solar system centre around the sun. The solar 
system is quite small compared to the vastness of the amazing universe. The earth is 
quite insignificant. The solar system is many billion times larger than the earth in size. 
The solar system also includes various gaseous substances and dust particles. The 
gravitional force of the sun make all the planets, satellites, comets and meteors to 
rotate around the sun. The solar system is many times larger in area than the earth. 
Sun : The sun is actually, a star. It is a yellow coloured star of moderate size among the 
billions of stars in the milky way. Its diameter is 13 lakh and 84 thousand kms. and mass 
is nearly 1.99 × 1013 kilograms. Of all the luminaries in the solar system, the sun has a 
very important place. Our relationship with the sun is very close. The sun is a heated 
star. The temperature at the centre of the sun is about 150,000,000° Celsius and at the 
surface it is about 6,000° Celsius. It is the source of light and heat of the earth but also of 
other planets and satellites. The earth would have been eternally dark without sun light. 
There would be no pulsation of life and no animal or plant would live in this world.
Luminaries and Solar System	 5 
The planets of the solar system are arranged according to their distance from the sun 
such as Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Of all the 
planets, Jupiter is the largest and the Mercury, the smallest. The description of these 
planets as arranged in the above order is given bellow : 
Mercury : Mercury is the smallest planet of the solar system. It is nearest to the sun 
from where the average distance is 58 crore kilometres and the diameter of this planet 
is 4,850 kilometres. The planet takes 88 days to rotate once round the sun. So, for 
Mercury 88 days make a year. It takes 58 days and 17 hours to revolve round its own 
axis. So, one day of Mercury is equivalent to our 58 days and 17 hours. The 
temperature of the planet is very high because of its closeness to the sun. The metals 
like zinc or lead dissolves into vapour in such temperature. There is no atmosphere in 
Mercury. There is no cloud, rain, wind or water and hence life is non-existent in this 
planet. The picture that was sent by the space craft Mariner-10 in 1974 shows that the 
surface of the Mercury is quite similar to that of the moon. It is rugged and full of 
holes. There are innumerable hills and plain lands. Mercury has no satellite. 
Venus : You must have heard about the morning star or the evening star and might 
have seen it too. Venus is, in fact, not a star. It glows in the sky like a star which 
prompts us to call it a star. Venus is covered under dense cloud. Naturally, the sun is 
never visible from its surface. The sun is 108 crore kilometres from Venus. The Venus 
is the nearest planet to the earth. There is little difference of light between day and 
night. The dense cloud in Mercury is formed of carbon dioxide cloud. The rain that 
falls here is actually acid rain. The diameter of the Mercury is 12,104 kilometres. It 
takes 225 days for the Venus to revolve round the sun. Venus rotates on its axis very 
slowly. The sun rises twice and sets twice in the sky of Venus. Venus has no satellite. 
Earth : Earth is the third closest planet to the sun. The average distance of the earth 
from the sun is 15 crore kilometres. Its diameter is nearly 12,667 kilometres. The

earth takes 23 hours 56 minutes and 4 seconds to rotate on its own axis. The earth 
takes 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes 47 seconds to revolve round the sun once. So, one 
year is equivalent to 365 days. The moon is the single satellite of the earth. The earth 
is the only planet in whose atmosphere there is existence of required oxygen, nitrogen 
and temperature that is necessary for the survival of plants and animals in the world. 
Hence, the earth is considered as the most important planet of the solar system. 
Mars : The orbit of the earth is next to earth in the solar system. Its diameter is about 
6,787 kilometres which is half of the earth. The average distance of this planet is 22.8 
crore kilometres from the sun and 7.7 crore kilometres from the earth. Mars has two 
satellites. One of them is Phobos and the other is Deimos. The day and night in Mars 
are nearly the same as that of the earth is respect of period of time. The earth takes 
365 days to revolve round the sun. Whereas the Mars takes 687 days. The planet takes 
24 hours and 37 minutes to rotate on its own axis. There are gorges and volcanoes in 
the surface of the Mars. The planet has little oxygen and water but the quantity of 
carbon dioxide is so high that the existence of life is not possible. The planet looks 
reddish since the rocks became rusty getting in contact with oxygen as the available 
reports show. 
Asteroids : There is no planet within a distance of 56.31 crore kilometres from Mars. 
There are many little luminaries in this vast space. All these luminaries having a 
diameter ranging from 1.6 kilometres to 805 kilometres are called Asteroids. The 
scientists have identified the orbits of thousands of Asteroids. As all these remain in a 
group, hence called Asteroids. 
Jupiter : Jupiter is called the king of the planets because it is the largest planet. Its 
diameter is 1,42,800 kilometres. It is 1,300 times larger than the earth in area. Its mass 
is twice as much as any other planet in the solar system. This Planet is 77.8 crore 
kilometres from the sun. The temperature of the surface of atmosphere is very low but 
in the interior, it is quite high. The average temperature is 125° Celsius. Jupiter takes 
nearly 12 years to revolve round the sun but it takes 9 hours 53 minutes to rotate on its 
own axis. So in one day as of our earth, the sun rises twice and sets twice in this 
planet. The scientists have discovered, so far, 16 satellites. Of these, Lo, Uropa, 
Ganimed and Callistro are the major satellites. The scientists think that heavy 
atmosphere exists here. 
Saturn : Saturn is the second largest planet of the solar system. The sun is 143 crore 
kilometres away from Saturn. It is actually a huge gaseous globe and its diameter is 
1,20,000 kilometres. Saturn is 760 times greater than that of the earth. Saturn takes 29 
years and 5 months to revolve round the sun once but rotates on its own axis in 10 
hours 40 minutes. There are thousands of rings surrounding the Saturn having 
different colours. Saturn has 22 satellites outside its ring. Of these Titan, Hua, Dion, 
Capitus and Tethris are remarkable. The surface of the Saturn remains covered by ice. 
The atmosphere contains hydrogen, a mixture of helium, methane and ammonia gas.
Luminaries and Solar System	 7 
Uranus : Uranus is the third largest planet. In order of distance from the sun its place 
is seventh. It is located at a distance of 287 crore kilometres from the sun. The planet 
takes 84 years to complete a single rotation round the sun but it takes only 10 hours 49 
minutes to rotate on its own axis. Its diameter is nearly 49,000 kilometres. It is very 
light because it is formed of light substances. The atmosphere contains high 
percentage of methane. Average temperature 170° Celsius. Recently, scientists have 
discovered some rings round this planet, but these rings are not bright. Uranus has 5 
(five) satellites such as Mirinda, Ariel, Ambriel, Titania and Oberon. 
Neptune : In order of distance from the sun, Neptune is placed in 8th position. It is 
about 450 crore kilometres from the sun. This planet has got feeble light and heat. 
Neptune in area is equivalent to 72 earths and 17 earths in mass. Its Diameter is 
48,400 kilometres. The atmosphere which is formed of the mixture of gas mainly 
methane, ammonia and other gases. This planet was first sighted by the scientists in 
1846. It has two satellites such as Triton and Neroid. Moreover, two rings have been 
recently discovered to exist round this planet. 
Luminaries and Solar System 
What we learnt from this chapter : 
Luminaries : The planets, stars, satellites, comets, meteors, pulsar, Black Dwarf, 
Black Holes that exist in boundless space are called the Luminaries. 
Stars : At night and clear sky, the luminaries that twinkle in the space are called stars. 
Nebulae : The covering of the dimly lit stars in the space are called nebulae. 
The Milky Way : The brightly, illuminated long pathway running from north to south 
formed by cluster of stars is called the milky way. 
Comets : Sometimes a kind of luminaries appear in the space. They exist for a short 
period and then disappear. They are known as comets. Halley’s comet appear in the 
sky every 75 years. 
Planets : The celestial bodies having no light or heat of their own revolve round the 
sun. They are called planets. The earth, mercury, saturn etc. are the planets. 
Satellite : The celestial bodies that revolve round a planet are satellites. The moon is a 
satellite. 
The Solar System : The family of celestial bodies that include the sun and its planets, 
satellites, asteroids, comets, and meteors is called the solar system. There are eight 
planets in the solar system. They are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Saturn, Jupiter, 
Uranus and Neptune.

Chapter Two 
Latitude and Longitude 
Some imazinary lines extending from east to west and from north to south are drawn 
on a map of the world to determine the location of any place. These lines are known 
as the parallels of latitude and the meridians of longitude respectively. In geography, 
latitude and longitude are two important topics. One can determine the location of a 
place with the help of latitude and longitude. With the location of the longitude, one 
can determine the time of that place. Moreover, the northern and the southern position 
of any place can be determined through latitudes. Similarly, the western and the 
eastern position of any location from the Prime Meridian can be ascertained by 
longitude. Degree of latitude or a part of it is known as the latitude, while the degree 
of longitude of a part of it is termed as longtitude. 
Latitude : Before we learn what is actually meant by the degree of latitude, we will 
have to have an idea about the axis, the equator and parallels of latitudes. The 
imazinary line which runs north to south through the centre of the earth is known as 
axis. The northernmost point of this axis is known as the north pole and the 
southernmost point is the south pole. Keeping both the poles in equal distance, an 
imazinary line has been drawn which encircles the globe from west to east is known 
as the equator or the terrestrial equator. Due to the spherical shape of the earth, this 
line is also circular. So, this line is also known as the equatorial circle. 
The equator has divided the earth into two equal halves. The part lying north to the 
equator is known as the Northern Hemisphere and that to the south as the Southern 
Hemisphere. With the help of the 
equator, one can determine the angular 
distance of a place situated either in the 
northern or in the southern hemisphere. 
So, to find out the angular distance of a 
place upon the surface, the only thing 
is to be done is to connect with an 
imazinary line, any point of that place 
with the centre of the earth. Again, the 
meridian which passes over that point 
ultimately meets the equator on a 
certain point, and that the meeting 
point is connected by an imazinary line 
with the centre of the earth (Fig. 3). 	 
Fig. 3 : Angular distance from equator
10	 Secondary Geography 
Fig. 4 : Equatorial plane, north pole and south pole 
The imazinary line is actually the radius of the earth sphere. The value of the angle 
thus formed through those two lines is equivalent to the latitude of that particular place. 
Therefore, the latitude is the angular 
distance of a place north or south of 
the equator. If a line is drawn from 
any place on the earth to its centre 
then that line will create an angle with 
the equatorial plane. The value of that 
angle is the latitude of that place (Fig. 
4). The latitude of a place situated to 
the north of the equator is desigrated 
as the north latitude and that of the 
south as the south latitude. The total 
value of the angle created by the 
circle at the centre of the earth is 
360°. These angles are being 
divided into degrees (°), minutes (' ) and seconds ('' ). Thus the value of the equator is 
0°. The latitude of the north pole is 90° North and that of the south pole is 90° South. 
This is because that the angular distance of each of the poles is 90° from the equator. 
These angles are being divided into degrees and minutes and on the basis of these 
angles, the imazinary lines are drawn 
parallel to the equator. These are 
known as the parallels of latitudes. 
The latitudes are parallel to one 
another and every one of them is a 
full circle. The circumference of the 
latitudes decrease with the increase of 
their values. Some of the parallels arc 
quite important. The 23.5° latitude in 
the northern and southern hemispheres 
are known as theTropic of Cancer 
and the Tropic of Capricorn respectively. Besides, the 66.5° north and south latitudes 
are known as the Arctic and Antarctic circles respectively (Fig. 5). The equator is 
known as the great circle. The degree of latitude of all the places located in the same 
parallel is the same.

The latitude of the region near the equator, in other words, the latitudes having the 
value of 0° to 30° are called the low latitudes. Similarly, latitudes having the value of 
30° to 60° are known as the mid latitude and those of 60° to 90° are the high latitudes. 
There are different methods of determining the latitude of a place. Out of them we are 
discussing about two methods. 
(a) With the help of a pole star, and 
(b) With the help of a sextant and the position of the sun in the horizon. 
(a) Determining latitude with the help of a pole star : We know that the earth is 
divided into two hemispheres, the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere. 
Every night from any place of the northern hemisphere one can see the pole star in a fixed 
position in the northern sky. But the altitude of the pole star from the horizon does not 
remain the same. It differs with the difference of the place, that means, the altitude of the 
pole star in the horizon is different for different places. In the equator, the location of the 
pole star is in the horizon and its altitude is 0°. From the equator towards north pole for 
every 1° of approach the altitude also increases by 1°. Ultimately in the pole, the altitude 
of the pole star rises to 90°. So, the degree of latitude for the equator is 0° and that of the 
north pole is 90°. In other words, the degree of latitude increases with any approach 
towards the north pole. Thus the latitude of any place in the northern hemisphere is 
equivalent to the degree of altitude of pole star. So, the latitude of any place can be 
derived from the altitude of the pole star. But it is not possible to determine the latitude of 
any place in the southern hemisphere by the pole star, nor possible to determine the 
latitude through this method in day time. 
(b) Determination of latitude by sextant : Sextant is an instrument by which the 
altitude of the sun can be measured. The latitude of any place can be determined after 
finding out the altitude of the noon sun with the help of a sextant. The following formula 
can be applied to find out the latitude of a place. 
The formula is : 90° minus the altitude of the sun at noon ± the sun’s declination. 
So, the latitude = 90°- altitude of the sun - declination 
	= 90 °- 50°-15° = 90°- 65° = 25° south. 
If the place under consideration is in the northern hemisphere then it will require to 
add the declination value of north and to subtract the declination value of south. 
Similarly, if the place is in the southern hemisphere then the declination value of south 
is to added and that of the north to be subtracted.

Meridians of Longitude 
The terrestrial equator can be graduated to degrees, minutes and seconds and through 
these points imazinary lines can be drawn from north to south pole which are known 
as the meridians of longitude. The 
longitudes are also known as 
meridians. The meridian which passes 
through the Greenwich can be taken 
as the Prime Meridian and the angular 
distance of the meridians can be 
measured from the prime meridian 
(Fig. 6). 
Prime Meridian 
The meridian which passes from north to 
south pole through Greenwich in the 
neighbourhood of London is termed as the 
Prime Meridian. The value of this line has been determined as 0°. 
Other meridians of longitudes can be drawn through the angular distance from the 
Prime Meridian. For example, the meridians that lie 45° East of the prime meridian is 
known as 45° East Longitude or east meridian and all the places lying on this 
longitude has the same longitudinal value of 45° East Longitude. So, we can say that 
the longitude of any given point on the globe is measured as an angular distance 
eastward or westward from the prime meridian. We further know that the longitude of 
the prime meridian is 0°. The value of the angles created by the circumference at 
centre of the earth is 360°. So, if 360° meridians are drawn from pole to pole at equal 
interval of 1°, then they will lie at 1° of longitude apart. Hence, the total number of 
360° meridians are equally divided into two parts of 180° each in the western and the 
eastern side of the prime meridian. As the earth is a sphere, so the 180° east and west 
longitude is virtually the same line. Like that of the latitudes, the longitudes can also 
be divided into minutes and seconds. One minute of longitude is 1/60th part of a 
degree of longitude. The value of both the latitude and longitude will be 0° when the 
prime meridian crosses the equator vertically. And this point has been recognised as a 
place located somewhere in the Gulf of Guinea. 
Determination of longitude : The longitude of a place can be determined by two 
methods. These are : (I) by the difference of local time, (2) by Greenwich mean time. 
(1) By the difference of local time : We know that the earth is a sphere. It has been 
moving continuously around its own axis from west to east. Consequently different 
places of the earth have been facing the sun at different times. Whenever, the meridian of

Latitude and Longitude	 13 
any place comes in front of the sun i.e. when the sun appears just overhead, then it is 
considered as noon and the local time is taken as 12 noon. Ultimately other times of 
the place are determined on the basis of local time. We know that there is a difference 
of 4 minutes of time for 1° of difference of longitude. In other way, we can say that 
for every 4 minutes, the longitude differs by 1°. For example, if in any place, the local 
time is 12 noon, then the local time for any place located 5° east of the previous place 
will be 12.00 noon + (5° × 4 minutes) = 12 hours 20 minutes. For the place lying 5° 
west of the former place, the local time would be 12.00 noon - (5° × 4 minutes) = 
12.00 - 20.00 minutes = 11 hours 40 minutes. 
(2) By Greenwich mean time : We all know that the longitude of Greenwich is 0°. 
The actual time of Greenwich can be read from the Chronometer. To determine the 
longitude of a place by sextant, one will have to record the highest altitude that the 
sun attains there at noon and that position will have to be treated as 12.00 noon. The 
longitude of the place mentioned above can now be determined from the difference of 
time that occurs between the indicated place and Greenwich. If the place is located 
east of Greenwich then the local time would be more than that of Greenwich and if it 
is located west of the Greenwich, its local time would be less than that of Greenwich. 
Differences between parallels and meridians : 
1. All the parallels of latitude are parallel to each other but the meridians are not; 
2. All the parallels are full circles and the meridians are half circles; 
3. The lengths of each of the meridians are equal but that of parallels are not equal; 
4. Parallels always run in a east-west direction, whereas the meridians in a north-	 	 
south direction; 
5. The highest value of parallel is 90°, whereas that of meridian is 180°. 
Local and Standard Time 
Local Time : Everyday the earth moves round her axis from west to east. As a result, 
the sun appears earlier in the places located in the east. Due to rotation of the earth, 
the sun reaches the zenith of the sky, or in other words, the sun reaches its highest 
altitude on a certain place and that hour is treated as 12.00 noon. On the basis of this 
noon time, the other time for the day is determined. The time thus determined is the 
local time for that place. So, the local time of a place is determined on the basis of the 
highest altitude of the sun which can be observed with the help of a sextant. 
The earth at the centre creates 360°. The earth requires 1,440 minutes (24 hours × 60 
minutes) to cover this distance of 360° for one time. So, the earth needs 4 minutes 
(1,440 ÷ 360) to rotate 1° of longitude. Therefore, for 1° difference of longitude, the 
difference of time will be 4 minutes. 
Standard Time : If the sun’s noon position on the meridian is taken as 12 O’ clock 
and if that is accepeted as the basis of determining the local time then this would 
create confusion in maintaining, time among the different parts of the same country. 
14	 Secondary Geography 
To avoid this confusion each country of the world has introduced a new concept of 
maintaining time known as standard time. The standard time of the country is that 
time which passes through the central part of the country. 
There may be several standard times for a large country like the United States of 
America and Canada. The United States of America has four different standard times, 
whereas Canada has five. In those countries, more than one standard time has been 
introduced to run administration and other works more efficiently relating to postal, 
railway, wireless, telephone etc. The local time of Greenwich (0° meridian) has been 
accepted as the standard time for the world. Accordingly, the standard time in 
Bangladesh is six hours ahead of Greenwich time. 90° East meridian has passed 
through the middle part of the country and the standard time of Bangladesh is 
calculated from the local time of that meridian. 
Antipodes : Antipode means the relative position of two places which are situated on the 
earth’s surface just opposite to each other. To locate the antipode of a place an imazinary 
straight line is drawn through the earth from that place to the opposite position 
which passes through the centre. The 
point where this line touches the 
opposite side of the globe is the 
antipodal position to the former point 
(Fig. 7). That means the later point is 
the antipodal to the former point. 
If the latitude of a place is known then 
the latitude of its antipode can be 
ascertained. The latitude of a place 
will be the same as that of its 
antipode. The two places must be 
situated on the different sides of the 
equator, that means one is in the 
northern hemisphere and the other 
one in the southern hemisphere. So, if 
the latitude of a place is 70° North, then the latitude of its antipode will be 70° South. 
The total value of the meridian of a place and that of its antipode will always be 180°. 
The meridian of a place if be east, the meridian of the antipode would be west. For 
example, the antipode of 40° East longitude will be 180°-- 40° = 140° West longitude. 
The difference of time for these two places will be 12 hours. In fig. 7, the point B is 
the antipode of A. The antipode of Dhaka is situated in the Pacific near Chile of South 
America.

Latitude and Longitude	 15 
International Date Line 
Travelling towards east or west from any place will require adjustment of local time 
which ultimately creates problems even for adjustment of days of the week. This 
problems stands acute if anybody crosses 180° longitude towards east or west from a 
particular place. To avoid this problem or an imazinary line has been drawn absolutely 
over the waterbodies from north to south. This imazinary line is known as 
International Date Line. 
Necessity of the International Date Line : 
We know that for the difference of 1° of 
longitude, there is a difference of time of 4 
minutes. So, for every 15° of longitude, 
there will be a difference of an hour. Thus 
travelling eastward from prime meridian 
(Greenwich) up to 180°, one would be 12 
hours ahead of the schedule and travelling 
westward 12 hours behind the schedule. If it 
is 10 A.M. on Monday in Greenwich, then 
the corresponding time would be 10 P.M. on 
the same day at 180° East longitude, 
whereas, the time at 180° West longitude 
would be 10 P.M. on the previous day i.e. 
Sunday. But 180° East or 180° West 
longitude is virtually the same longitude. 
So, it is observed that the local time differs 
by 24 hours or one day in the same 
longitude. There is a change of day and date 
if one crosses this line which is known as 
the International Date Line (Fig. 8). 
Any ship or aeroplane sailing towards 
east from Greenwich will have to 
subtract one day and sailing towards 
west will have to add one day to adjust with the local time. 	 
The International Date Line is virtually 180° east and west longitude. It crosses 
through the Aleutian on the north-eastern part of Siberia, Fiji and Chatham islands. To 
avoid the problems of adjusting local time, the International Date Line has been so set 
that it passes only over the waterbodies turning 12° towards east just near the Bering 
Strait, 7° towards west near the Aleutian islands and 11° towards east near Fiji and 
Chatham islands. Had it not been drawn this way, the people would have to count two 
different local times in two different parts of the same island.

Determination of Longitude and Time 
Question 1. Two places, one located at 40°30¢ east and the other 50°30¢ west of 
Dhaka. What will be the local time of these two places when it is 8 A.M. at Dhaka? 
Solution 
The longitudinal difference of the first place from Dhaka is 40°30¢. 
For the difference of longitude, difference of time would be 
	= 	(40 ° × 4) minutes + (30¢ × 4) seconds 
	= 	160 minutes + 120 seconds 
	= 	160 minutes + 2 minutes =162 minutes 
	= 	2 hours 42 minutes. 
First place is located towards east of Dhaka, so the local time will be more than that of 
Dhaka. Now to determine the local time of the first place it requires to add 2 hours 42 
minutes with the local time of Dhaka. Therefore, the time will be 
	= 	(8 hours 0 minute 0 second) + (2 hours 42 minutes 0 second) 
	= 	10 hours 42 minutes A.M. 
Again, the difference of longitude between Dhaka and the second place is 50°30¢. 
So, the difference of time, 
	= 	(50 ° × 4) minutes + (30¢ × 4) seconds 
	= 	200 minutes + 120 seconds = 202 minutes 
	= 	3 hours 22 minutes. 
The second place is located towards west from Dhaka. Therefore, the local time of 
that place will be less, that means 3 hours 22 minutes will have to be deducted from the 
time of Dhaka. 
So, the local time of the place, 
	= 	(8 hours 0 minute 0 second) - (3 hours 22 minutes) 
	= 	4.38 A.M. = 4 hours 38 minutes A.M. 
Answer : 10 hours 42 minutes A.M. and 4 hours 38 minutes A.M. 
Question 2. The difference of time between Dhaka and Seoul is 2 hours 32 minutes. The 
longitude of Dhaka is 90° East and the local time is 6 hours 32 minutes in the morning. 
What will be local time and longitude of Seoul? 
Solution 
Seoul is the capital of South Korea, and is situated towards east from Dhaka. So, the local 
time of Seoul will be more than Dhaka. 
The local time of Dhaka is 6.32 A.M.
Latitude and Longitude	 17 
The local time of Seoul 	=	(6 hours 32 minutes) + (2 hours 32 minutes) 
	 	= 	8 hours 64 minutes 
	 	= 	9 hours 4 minutes 
	 	= 	9.04 A.M. 
	 	= 	9 hours 4 minutes A.M. 
Again the time difference between Dhaka and Seoul is 2 hours 32 minutes or 152 minutes. 
Difference of 4 minutes will make a longitudinal difference of 1° 
Difference of 1 minute will make a longitudinal difference = 
So, difference of 152 minutes will make a longitudinal difference =														 = 38° 
The longitude of Dhaka is 90° East. The longitude of Seoul will be more than Dhaka 
as it is situated towards east of Dhaka. 
So, the longitude of Seoul will be = 90° + 38° = 128° East. 
Answer : The local time of Seoul is 9 hours 4 minutes A.M. and the longitude of 
Seoul is 128°. 
Question 3. The Greenwich time is 20 minutes passed 7 A.M. If the time is the noon 
for any place, then determine the longitude of that place. 
Solution 
When the Greenwich time is 20 minutes passed 7 A.M. the local time of the particular 
place is 12 noon. The local time of the place is more than that of Greenwich. So, the 
place is located towards east of Greenwich, in effect it is located in the east longitude. 
The difference of time between these two places is 
	= 	(12 hours - 7 hours 20 minutes) 
	= 	4 hours 40 minutes = 280 minutes 
For every 4 minutes difference of time, the difference of longitude stands at 1°. 
Therefore, for every 1 minute difference of time, the difference of longitude will be 
So, for the difference of 280 minutes the longitudinal difference will be 													= 70° 
Therefore, the difference of longitude between Greenwich and that particular place 
will be 70° East. 
So, that result will be 70° East. 
Question 4. Dhaka is located at 90°26¢ East longitude and Karachi is situated at 67° 
East longitude. If the local time of Karachi is 10 A.M. what will be the local time of 
Dhaka. 
Solution 
The difference of longitude between Dhaka and Karachi is (90°26¢ East - 67° East) 
= 23°26¢

18	 Secondary Geography 
For one degree difference of longitude, the difference of time will be 4 minutes. And 
for 1 minute difference of longitude the difference of time will be 4 seconds. 
Therefore, the difference of time between Dhaka and Karachi is : 
	= 	(23 ° × 4) minutes + (26¢ × 4) seconds 
	= 	92 minutes + 104 seconds 
	= 	93 minutes + (1 minute + 44 seconds) = 93 minutes 44 seconds 
	= 	1 hour , 33 minutes and 44 seconds. 
Dhaka is situated towards east from Karachi. So, the local time of Dhaka will be more 
than that of Karachi. 
Local time of Karachi is 10 A.M. So, to determine the local time of Dhaka it requires 
to add 1 hour 33 minutes and 44 seconds with the local time of Karachi, that means, 
with 10 A.M. 
Therefore, local time of Dhaka will be : 
	= 	10 hours + 1 hour 33 minutes and 44 seconds 
	= 	11 hours 33 minutes and 44 seconds in the morning. 
Answer : The local time of Dhaka will be 11 hours 33 minutes and 44 seconds A.M. 
Question 5. The latitude and longitude of a place is 40° North and 55° East 
respectively. Ascertain the latitude and longitude of its antipode. 
Solution 
The latitude of a place and its antipode are the same but each of them is located in the 
opposite hemisphere. The latitude of the place in question is 40° North. So, the 
latitude of its antipode will be 40° South. The longitude of the antipode will be 
(180°- the longitude of the place). 
The longitude of the place in question is 55° East. 
Therefore, the longitude of the antipode will be (180°--55°) - 125°. So, the longitude 
of the antipode is 125° West. 
Answer : The latitude and the longitude of the antipode is 40° South and 120° West 
respectively. 
Latitude and Longitude 
What we learnt from this chapter : 
Equator : The imaginary line lying midway between the poles, which encircles the 
earth from west to east. 
The latitude : The angular distance of a point on the earthÕs surface north or south of 
the equator, as measured from the centre of the earth, is the latitude, of that place. 
The lines of longitude : The imaginary lines which are drawn from north pole to 
south pole through equator connecting each of the different points created by 
graduating the equator into degrees, minutes and seconds.

Declination : The day when the sun gives its rays vertically over a latitude is the 
declination of the sun for that day. 
The Prime Meridian : The Prime Meridian is the line that passes from north to south 
over Greenwich near London. 
The Local Time : Due to rotation of the earth on its axis when the sun reaches its 
highest position in the sky in some particular place, it is taken as noon-day and the 
time records as 12 O’ clock. This is accepted as the Local Time of the place and other 
time of the day is calculated from this local time. 
Standard Time : The time which is referred to the mean time of a certain meridian. 
Every country determines its time from the meantime of the meridian which passes 
through the middle of that country and this is known as Standard Time of that country. 
Antipode : A point on the earth surface is known as antipode of another point when it 
is situated just on the opposite side of the globe corresponding to that point. 
International Date Line : From any fixed place if any body crosses the 180° 
longitude he will observe that it creates problems to determine the day of the week 
along with the differences of local time. To avoid this anomaly depending on 180° 
longitude, an imaginary line is drawn from north to south exclusively over the waters. 
The imaginary line is known as the International Date Line.

The Motion of the Earth	 21 
ROTATE EASTEARD 
CENTER OF THE EARTH 
Chapter Three 
The Motion of the Earth 
Everyday the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. This process led many people 
in the past to think that the sun is moving and the earth is fixed. The sun moves 
around the earth. But with the advancement of science, this has been proved that the 
sun itself is moving and the earth has also motion. Later it has been revealed that the 
sun does not move around the earth, rather the earth moves around the sun. The earth 
not only moves around the sun, it also rotates on its own axis. The motion of the earth 
is of two types : (1) to rotate on its own axis, and (2) to revolve around the sun in its 
own orbit. The rotational motion of the earth is known as Diurnal motion and the 
revolutionary motion is called the annual motion. 
Diurnal Motion 
The earth has motion. Centering the sun, the earth moves from west to east on its axis. 
This motion of the earth is known as rotation. The earth takes 23 hours 56 minutes 
and 4 seconds or nearly 24 hours 
to rotate once on its axis. This 
period of 24 hours is regarded as 
one day. This diurnal movement 
of the earth is the rotation. One 
such full rotation of the earth is 
known as solar day. The earth 
takes a full day to complete 
rotation once on her axis. 
The speed of rotation is different 
in different places. The speed of 
rotation at the equator is highest. 
Here the speed of rotation is more 
than 1,610 kilometres per hour. 
This speed decreases towards 
north and south of the equator. 
The speed of the rotation is nearly 
zero at the poles. Though the 
diurnal motion exists, but still we 
don’t feel due to the following 
reasons :

22	 Secondary Geography 
1. 	Compared to the size of the earth, we are very much insignificant, so we do not 
feel the speed. 
2. 	 No fixed or movable object is available in front of the earth in the space which can 
be taken as the basis to understand the rotational speed of the earth. 
3. 	 Keeping pace with the speed of the earth, the atmosphere also moves from west to 
east. So, we, do not feel the rotational speed of the earth. 
4. 	 The rotational speed of each of the places of the earth is fixed. 
Evidences of Diurnal Rotation 
In the old days Ptolemy and his follower astronomers used to think that the earth was 
motionless. But subsequently astronomers like Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo and 
Newton gave their opinions in favour of the rotation of the earth. 
1. Everyday the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. From this phenomenon we 
can infer that either the sun of the earth is moving. This motion is accomplished 
within one day or 24 hours. The sun is stationed about 15 crore kilometres away from 
the earth in the space. Being located at such a long distance, it is not possible for the 
sun to revolve round the earth within 24 hours. Moreover the tremendous speed the 
sun requires to move round the earth will be even more than the speed of the light, 
which is simply impossible. Because no object can move faster than light. So, it is not 
the sun but the earth which rotates on its own axis in 24 hours. 
2. The shape of the earth : The earth is inflated in the middle and is compressed 
towards the poles. If any pliable object or matter rotates around its axis, it acquires 
such a condition. The present shape of the earth is the result of such rotational speed. 
Scientist Newton had the opinion that due to the rotational motion, the earth acquired 
the present shape. 
3. Due to rotation of the earth, changes also occur in ocean currents and wind system. 
According to Ferrel’s Law, it is due to the rotation of the earth that the air and the 
ocean currents are deflected to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in 
the southern hemisphere. 
4. It is observed that if a stone is thrown from a high place, it does not reach the gound 
vertically, rather it moves slightly towards the east. This proves that the earth rotates 
from west to east or the earth has rotational motion (Fig. 9). 
5. Primarily, tide occurs due to the attraction of the moon. The moon takes twenty 
seven days to complete one revolution around the earth. So, it is expected that the high 
tide would occur once every 27 days. But practically we observe that the high tide 
occurs every day which proves the rotational movement of the earth.
The Motion of the Earth	 23 
Fig. 10 : FoucaultÕs experiment 
6. French scientist Foucault, with the 
help of a pendulum proved the diurnal 
motion of the earth. He attached a pin 
at the bottom of the pendulum and 
hang it on the top of St. Pantheon 
church of Paris with a fixed motion, 
so that it would oscillate from north to 
south. Due to oscillation, the pin at 
the bottom of the pendulum started 
marking on the ground. Mr. Foucault 
observed that every time the marks 
have been deflected towards east. So, 
it can be proved that due to diurnal 
motion the earth rotates from west to 
east (Fig. 10).	 
Effects of Earth’s Rotation 
1. Occurance of day and night : One of the effects of the earth’s rotation is the occurance 
of day and night. We know that the 
earth is round and it does not have 
any light of its own. The earth 
becomes illuminated by the light of 
the sun. Due to diurnal motion, that 
part of the earth which faces the sun 
becomes illuminated. It is day in the 
illuminated portion of the earth. 
Sunlight does not reach the opposite 
part of the illuminated portion. So, 
it remains dark and it is night in the 
dark portion of the earth (Fig. 11). 
Due to rotation of the earth, alternately the illuminated portion becomes dark and the 
dark portion becomes illuminated and that is why the day and night are changed. 
When the dark portion is illuminated, it becomes day there. Similarly the illuminated 
portion turns dark, it becomes night there. Thus day and night have been occuring 
alternately. So, in some places it is 12 hours of day and 12 hours of night. 
If the shape of the earth would have been flat instead of being round, the rotation of the 
earth would create only day or only night. In other words, either only day or only night 
would exist simultaneously over the globe. On a specific date, in some parts of the 
earth it is day whereas in other parts it is night. That means when a portion of the earth

remains dark the other part becomes illuminated. The border of the lighted and the 
dark portion is called the shadow circle. Due to rotation, when the dark portion, after 
crossing the shadow circle faces the 
light, it is known as morning. The 
feeble light which precedes the morning 
is known as dawn and similarly the 
feeble light that precedes the evening is 
called twilight. In any place, when the 
sun reaches the highest elevation of the 
sky it is known as midday or noon and 
the time recorded is 12 O’ clock. But in 
the opposite point of that place it is 
midnight (Fig. 12). 
2. Temperature differences : It is due 
to the spherical shape and also for 
rotation that a comparatively small 
portion of the earth, located in the tropical areas between 23.5° North latitude to 
23.5° South latitude gets direct sunlight only for sometime of the year. The region 
where the sun gives its rays perpendicularly gets more heat. On the other hand, the 
areas located north and south of the region mentioned above get slanting rays and so 
these areas get less heat. 
3. Ocean currents, Tide and ebb and wind circulation : Diurnal motion of the earth 
creates rotational force which is responsible to change the direction of wind and ocean 
currents. So, as an effect of earth rotation, ocean current and the winds are deflected 
towards right in the northern hemisphere and towards left in the southern hemisphere. 
4. Determining the time : Due to rotation of the earth, it has become easier to 
calculate the time, since the period of one complete rotation of the earth can be 
divided into 24 parts and each of the parts can be calculated as an hour. Again the 
hour can be sub-divided to sixty divisions and the period of each of the divisions can 
be taken as a minute. Similarly, the minute can again be divided into sixty divisions 
taking each division as one second. 
5. Influence on nature and living creatures : If due to rotation of the earth, any 
change occurs in the field of temperature and light then such change influences the 
production, growth and character of living organisms. Had there been no diurnal 
motion some of the regions would remain ever dark and no plant could grow, while 
some other regions due to continuous sunshine would have been converted into desert.

The Motion of the Earth	 25 
Annual Motion 
According to Newton’s Law of Gravitation, the planets move around the stars due to 
their attraction. A law is also applicable to the solar system. In solar system each of 
the planets moves round the sun. The earth being a planet of the solar system, also 
moves on an elliptical orbit round the sun. The earth having a full rotation on her axis 
for 24 hours, simultaneously moves around the sun on a set route i.e. orbit once in a 
year. This movement of the earth is known as the annual motion. The earth takes 365 
days 6 hours to revolve around the sun in her orbit. The period, the earth takes to 
complete the revolution is known as the solar year. 
The circumference of the earth’s orbit is slightly more than 93 crore 80 lakhs and 827 
kilometres. The average speed of revolution is 1,06,260 kilometres per hour. In other 
words, the earth moves around the sun at a speed of 30 kilometres per second. 
Considering this speed, it requires 365 days 6 hours 48 minutes and 47 seconds to 
move round the sun for one time. But the solar year is calculated to be of 365 days. 
So, there remains a shortfall of about 24 hours or one day. To make up this deficit one 
extra day is added to the calendar in every fourth year. And that year is calculated as 
of 366 days. The month of February is calculated to be of 29 days instead of 28 days. 
This year is regarded as Leap Year and the leap year is taken to be of 366 days. 
Revolution of the earth is responsible to create fluctuation in the duration of day and 
night. It is also responsible to bring changes in the march of seasons. 
Effects of Annual Motion 
I. Fluctuation of day and night : The duration of the days and nights fluctuate in the 
same time in the different parts of the year due to the revolution of the earth. As a 
result, it is observed that in the same latitude, the length of day and night fluctuate in 
different periods of the year. 
In the process of revolutionary motion the earth, on 2lst June reaches in such a 
position that the sun’s rays fall vertically on the northern most position of the earth, 
that means, on 23.5° North latitude or on the Tropic of Cancer. At this time, the 
northern hemisphere remains inclined more towards the sun and the southern 
hemisphere remains at the furthest distance from the sun. That is why the length of the 
day is greater and the temperature is higher in the northern hemisphere. So, 21st June 
is the longest day and shortest night in the northern hemisphere. The sun reaches its 
northern most limit on 21st June and the date is known as Summer Solstice. 
The sunshines vertically over the equator on 21st March and 23rd September. On these 
two dates, the sun remains in equal distance from the north and south poles. So, on 
these two dates, the duration of the day and night is equal (12 hours day and 12 hours 
night) over the entire world. The day when the day and night are equal over the globe, 
is known as the Equinoxes. 21st March is spring in northern hemisphere. So, 21st 
26	 Secondary Geography 
March is called the Vernal Equinox, and 23rd September is Autumn northern 
hemisphere, so 23rd September is known as Autumnal Equinox. 
The southern hemisphere shows maximum inclination towards the sun on 22nd 
December. So, on that date it is the longest day and the shortest night in the southern 
hemisphere. The sun reaches its southernmost position on this day and the date is 
known as the Winter Solstice. The sun gives its rays vertically over 23.5° South 
latitude or Tropic of Capricorn. 
Proofs of Annual Motion 
1. The apparent motion of the stars : As we cannot feel the occurence of earth’s 
rotation, similarly we cannot perceive the existence of earth’s revolution. But with the 
changing locations of the stars from east to west at night sky, we can comprehend that 
the earth has an annual motion or the revolution. By looking at the stars in a clear sky 
one can understand the gradual movement of the stars from east to west. 
2. The changing locations of the sun in the sky : The sun is seen to be located in 
different positions in different periods of the year. We can observe that on 21st March 
and 23rd September, the sun rises at a point due east on the horizon and sets at a point 
due west on the horizon. Again, we can see that on 21st June and 22nd December, the 
sun rises at north-eastern horizon and south-eastern horizon in the sky respectively. 
From 21st June to 23rd December, the sun seems to have an apparent motion towards 
south. This is known as southerly movement of the sun. Again from 22nd December to 
21st June, it seems that the sun is apparently moving towards north and this movement 
of the sun is known as northerly movement. 
3. The revolutionary motion of different planets : It has been observed through 
telescope that all the planets are revolving around the sun. The earth as a planet also 
has revolutionary speed or annual motion. 
4. Direct observation : Recently the spaceman from spaceship has observed the 
revolution of the earth. 
5. The Law of Gravitation : In comparison to the sun, the earth is very small. The 
sun is 13 lakh times greater than the earth. So, it is naturally thought that due to 
gravitation the earth moves round the sun. 
Change of Seasons 
The whole year is being divided into 4 divisions on the basis of the variation of 
temperature. Each of the divisions is known as a season. These are the Summer, the 
Autumn, the Winter and the Spring. It is to be noted here that when summer prevails 
in the northern hemisphere, winter sets in the southern hemisphere. Again, when there 
is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer in the southern hemisphere. 
Similarly, when it is spring in the northern hemisphere, it is autumn in the southern 
hemisphere and it is spring in the southern hemisphere when it is autumn in the 
northern hemisphere.
The Motion of the Earth	 27 
Reasons for change of seasons : Due to the difference of temperature, the clange of 
seasons does occur. The reasons for difference of temperature and as well as that of 
seasons are the following : 
1. Difference in solar heat; 
2. The earth is round. So, some places get direct sunshine, whereas in other places it 
falls at a slanting position. As a result, it creates difference in temperature which in 
turn causes to change the season. 
3. The orbit of the earth is elliptical. So the distance of the earth from the sun 
fluctuates. As a result, it creates difference in temperature which ultimately brings 
changes in season. 
4. The axis of the earth makes a fixed inclination of about 66.5° with the plane of the 
ecliptic. As a result, once in a year the north pole or the south pole shows inclination 
towards the sun. Temperature increases in the hemisphere when it remains inclined 
towards the sun and in opposite case the temperature decreases. As a result, the season 
changes. 
Perihelion and Aphelion : The orbit of the earth is an ellipse. Its length is 
93,80,51,827 kilometres. The sun is located in the centre or in the focus of the ellipse. 
Perihelion : In the process of revolution around the sun, the earth on 1st to 3rd January 
reaches in such a position that the distance between the sun and the earth becomes the 
lowest. It is about 14 crore 65 lakh 83 thousand 5 hundred kilometres. This position of 
the earth on that date is known as Perihelion. In Perihelion position the axis of the 
earth lie aslant outside the orbit (Fig. 13). 
Aphelion : As the orbit of the earth is ellipse, the distance between the sun and the 
earth does not remain fixed for all the time of the year. Sometimes the distance 
increases and other times it decreases. In the first half of July, particularly on 4th July, 
the distance between the sun and the earth becomes the highest being 15 crore 14 lakh 
20 thousand and 500 kilometres. This position of the earth is known as Aphelion.

28	 Secondary Geography 
The process of changing of season : Normally, we know that there are four seasons in the 
earth viz., the summer, the autumn, the winter and the spring. Now we will try to 
understand how the changes of season do occur. The explanations for the change of seasons 
may be obtained from four situations of the earth during revolution around the sun. 
1. Summer in the Northern Hemisphere and Winter in the Southern Hemisphere : 
We know that the north pole comes nearer to the sun once in a year. During revolution 
on her orbit, the north pole of the earth after 21st March, starts showing inclination 
towards the sun. Consequently, a large portion of the northern hemisphere is being 
illuminated by the rays of the sun. The area of illumination gradually increases. As a 
result, the days become longer and the nights shorter in the northern hemisphere. As the 
days become longer the sun gives its rays for a longer time in the northern hemisphere. 
The earth gets more time to receive heat and the heated earth in turn makes the 
surrounding air to be hot. Nights are short and the amount of radiation from the soil is 
less in comparison to the amount of heat that is stored during day time. Thus hot 
weather prevails in the northern hemisphere and so it is summer there. 
At this time opposite condition prevails in the southern hemisphere. Since the 
southern hemisphere remains far from the sun and it gets sunshine for a shorter time. 
So the nights are long and the days are short. The earth radiates the heat which she has 
stored at day time. As a result, the earth becomes cold. Cold weather prevails in the 
southern hemisphere and it is winter there. 
2. Autumn in the Northern Hemisphere and Spring in the Southern Hemisphere : 
After 21st June, the length of the day starts decreasing and the length of night gets 
increasing in the northern hemisphere. But until 23rd September in comparison to night, 
the length of the day still remains shorter. The north pole which is inclined towards the sun 
starts moving away from the sun and from a distant position the southern hemisphere 
gradually inclined towards the sun i.e. the south polar region comes nearer to the sun. 
Consequently temperature gradually decreases in the northern hemisphere and it increases 
in the southern hemisphere. This condition is known as Autumn in the northern 
hemisphere and Spring in the southern hemisphere. On 23rd September the day and night 
are equal throughout the world (Fig. 14). 
Fig. 14 : Revolution of earth-fluctuation of day and night-change of season 
W
The Motion of the Earth	 29 
•3. Winter in the Northern Hemisphere and Summer in the Southern Hemisphere : 
We know that after 23rd September, the southern hemisphere starts showing 
inclination towards the sun. One can perceive that everyday the sun moves southward. 
This is known as southwardly movement of the sun. In comparison to night, the days 
become longer in the southern hemisphere as the south pole shows inclination towards 
the sun. As the sun’s rays fall directly on the Tropic of Capricorn, the southern 
hemisphere gets sun rays for a longer period of time. Consequently, the temperature 
increases in the southern hemisphere. On 22nd December, the south pole approaches to 
the nearest position towards the sun and it is the longest day in the southern 
hemisphere. So, one and half months preceding 22nd December and the same period 
following that date the temperature remains high in the southern hemisphere. 
Naturally, during this period, the temperature remains very low in the northern 
hemisphere. So, one and half months preceding 22nd December, it is summer in the 
southern hemisphere and it is winter in the northern hemisphere. 
Fig. 15 : Main seasons 
4. Spring in the Northern Hemisphere and Autumn in the Southern Hemisphere : 
The sun starts moving towards the north after 22nd December. The length of the day 
starts decreasing in the southern hemisphere and increasing in the northern hemisphere. 
Consequently, the temperature increases gradually in the northern hemisphere and 
decreases in the southern hemisphere. Again day and night become equal in duration on 
21st March. On this date the sun,s position is vertical on the equator. This is known as 
autumnal equinox. This is spring in the northern hemisphere and autumn in the southern 
hemisphere (Fig. 15).
30	 Secondary Geography 
The Motion of the Eearth 
What we learnt from this chapter : 
Diurnal motion : The earth rotates on its own axis once in 24 hours or in a day. This 
motion of the earth is called the diurnal motion. The diurnal motion causes the 
occurance of days and nights and the variation of temperature, whereas, this motion 
controls the ocean currents, tide and ebb and the wind movements. 
Annual motion : The earth revolves round the sun on a fixed orbit once in a year. 
This motion of the earth is called the annual motion. The fluctuation in the duration of 
the days and nights and the changes of seasons do occur due to this annual motion. 
Seasons : The whole year has been divided into four divisions. Each of such division 
is known as a season. There are four seasons viz., summer, Autumn, winter and 
spring. 
Change of seasons : The change of seasons occurs mainly due to the variation of 
temperature. Difference in temperature of the sun, the round shape of the earth, the 
rotation of the earth etc. are the causes of the change of season. 
Perihelion and Aphelion : The earth, on 1st to 3rd January, is positioned at a shortest 
distance from the sun and this of the earth is known as Perihelion. Again, the earth on 
1st to 4th July, remains at the furthest distance from the sun and such position of the 
earth is known as Aphelion.

Physical Geography 
Introduction 
The landforms created by the different geographic processes under different 
environments on the earth’s surface are included in the physical geography. The 
subject matter of physical geography can be divided into three major divisions viz., 
lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere. Though each of these divisions possesses 
individual qualities, yet they are interrelated. Besides, they collectively maintain the 
biosphere. The lithosphere, atmosphere and hydrosphere are interlinked with each 
other and the biosphere has been developed based on the elements taken from them 
(Fig. 16). Let us cite an example. The people is using lithosphere for agriculture 
depending on the river water or reserviors (part of the hydrosphere). Again, solar heat 
is needed (part of the atmosphere) to increase the agricultural production. The 
lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere are discussed respectively.

Chapter One 
Lithosphere 
Earth’s crust and the interior of the earth : The earth is almost like a sphere. Its 
radius is about 6,400 kilometres. There is no scope to observe the interior of the earth 
by piercing the hard external covering. The geologists by observing the characteristics 
of the seismic waves, gravitation and the characteristics of the magnetic field have 
developed some idea about the elements and structure of the earth’s interior. 
Depending on the worldwide collected information, the earth from the surface to the 
centre has been divided into three strata. These are (a) the earth’s crust, (b) barysphere 
and (c) centrosphere. 
(a) The earth’s crust : The hard stratum of the rock covering the outer shell of the whole 
earth is known as the earth’s crust (Fig. 17). The thickness of the earth’s crust is the lowest in 
comparison to the other interior layers of the earth. On an average, it is about 20 kilometres. 
The thickness of the earth’s crust on 
an average is about 35 kilometres 
beneath the continents and only 5 
kilometres beneath the ocean. 
Generally, the continental earth’s 
crust is known as SIAL which is 
composed of Silicon (Si) and of 
Aluminium (Al). On the other hand, 
the earth’s crust beneath the ocean is 
composed of basalt which is heavier 
than that of Sial layer and its major 
elements are Silicon (Si) and 
Magnesium (Mg) and is generally 
known as SIMA. It is inferred that 
probably this basalt stratum has been 
existing throughout the world as a coating beneath the Sial and in the bottom of the 
seas and oceans. The temperature beneath the earth’s crust increased by 30° Celsius 
for every kilometre of depth. 
(b) Barysphere : The stratum beneath the earth’s crust is the barysphere. But, there is 
a thin layer between the earth’s crust and the barysphere. The Yogoslavian 
Seismographer Mohorovicic in 1909 first discovered this layer of seperation. So, the 
layer has been known as Mohorovicic Discontinuity. The layer of barysphere is 2,885 
kilometres thick which is extended from Mohorovicic upto the outskirts of the 
Fig. 17 : The cross section of the formation of earth’s interior 
Source : Trabuck and Lutgens (1994)
34	 Secondary Geography 
centrosphere (Fig. 18). The rocks of the upper part of the centrosphere are hard and 
brittle and this layer is about 100 kilometres deep. The earth’s crust and the upper part 
of the barysphere is 100 kilometres thick and this collectively known as rocksphere or 
lithosphere. 
Fig. 18 : Asthenosphere, lithosphere and mohorovicic discontinuity 
The rocks beneath the hard layer of barysphere being close to the melting point are 
partially soft and this layer extends downwards for about 300 kilometres. This layer is 
known as Asthenosphere. This hard layer of rock can move slowly over the 
Asthenosphere. The upper part of the barysphere is made of silicate which is primarily 
composed of iron and magnesium. It is assumed that the lower part of the barysphere 
(700 to 2,885 kilometres) is constituted of the minerals composed of complete mixture 
of iron oxide (FeO), Magnesium Oxide (MgO) and the Silicon dioxide (SiO2). The 
temperature of the barysphere at 100 kilometres depth ranges from about 1,100° 
Celsius to 1,200° Celsius which increases to 1,900° Celsius at a depth of 700 
kilometres and to 3,000° Celsius at the outskirts of the centrosphere. 
(c) Centrosphere : The centrosphere is a layer which is extended from the lower part 
of the barysphere upto the centre of the earth. The thickness of this layer is about 3,486 
kilometres (Fig.17). The centrosphere occupies about 16 per cent of the total area of 
the earth and its weight is about one-third of the total weight of the earth. The pressure 
of this layer is several lakh times more than the air pressure and the temperature ranges 
from 3,000° Celsius to 5,000° Celsius. It is learnt from the siesmic waves that the 
centrosphere has a liquid cover which is about 2,770 kilometres thick and has also a 
Earth crust beneath 
the oceans

hard inner cover which is about 1,216 kilometres thick. The major two elements of the 
centrosphere is Ferror (Fe) and Nickel (Ni) which is combinedly known as NiFe. 
Lithosphere 
What we learnt from this chapter : 
Earth’s crust and the interior of the earth : The earth’s crust and the interior of the 
earth can be divided into three divisions according to their mode of formation. These 
are (a) Earth’s crust on Lithosphere, (b) Barysphere and (c) Centrosphere. 
Earth’s crust : The thickness of the earth’s crust beneath the continent, on an average 
is 35 kilometres and beneath the ocean it is 5 kilometres. The upper layer of the 
earth’s crust is S1AL. The continents are primarily made of Sial rock. 
Barysphere and Lithosphere : The bottom layer of the earth’s crust is barysphere. 
This layer is about 2,885 kilometres thick. The earth’s crust and the upper part of the 
barysphere upto 100 kilometres is collectively known as rocksphere or lithosphere. 
Centrosphere : The layer extending from the lower part of the barysphere upto the 
centre of the earth is known as Centrosphere. This layer is about 3,480 kilometres 
thick.

Rocks and Minerals 
The outer cover of the earth’s surface is known as the earth’s crust. The earth’s crust is 
basically formed of the rocks composed of different minerals. These earth forming 
minerals serve out different purposes. As for example, mineral oil and coal are used as 
fuel. Moreover, the economic use of gold, copper, zinc, aluminium, nickel, iron etc. is 
also very much important. 
Different land forming processes like volcanism, depositional and erosional activities 
are highly influenced by the structure of the rocks and minerals. It is necessary to 
acquire some knowledge about minerals and rocks being the elements responsible for 
formimg the earth’s crust. 
First let us see what is meant by minerals? What is the difference between rocks and 
minerals? 
Minerals are formed by the composition of two or more basic elements. However, 
some minerals may be formed of one basic element. Diamond, gold, copper, silver, 
mercury and sulphur may be cited as examples. Of all these, the hardness of diamond 
is highest and of talc is lowest. 
On the other hand, the rocks are formed by the mixture of one or more minerals. Here, 
we mention the term mixture because in nature the minerals are found in mixed 
condition. Each of the rock forming minerals maintains its characteristic. Though 
much of the rocks are formed of more than one mineral, but in such case, the minerals 
and rocks are the same. As for example, calcite is a mineral while it is known as 
limestone as a rock. The characteristics of minerals are controlled by nature of the 
basic elements forming them. On the other hand, the property of rocks are regulated 
by the nature of the minerals constituting them. 
The rock family : The rocks are of three types according to their mode of origin. 
These are igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. Igneous and metamorphic 
rocks are formed by the processes accomplished in the interior of the earth. On the 
other hand, the sedimentary rocks are formed by the processes acting on the surface of 
the earth. Though the mode of formation of these rocks are different, yet they are 
interrelated. 
Igneous rocks : Igneous rocks can be formed under two environmental conditions 
viz., intrusive and extrusive. In the deep interior of the earth due to cooling, magma 
may be crystallized to form intrusive rock. If the magma finds its way to the surface of 
the earth through the vents, then it is termed as lava. This lava after cooling becomes 
extrusive rock (chart 1).
38	 Secondary Geography 
Intrusive rocks are sub-divided into plutonic and hypabyssal. Extrusive rocks are 
again sub-divided into explosive and quiet type. In intrusive type of rock, the magma 
solidifies in the deep interior of the earth. Granite, gabro, syenite, diorite etc. are the 
examples of intrusive rocks. In hypabyssal type, the magma solidifies in the shallow 
interior as Porphyry. 
Magma when thrown by violent explosions into the air after being solidified gives 
birth to the explosive Igneous rocks. Tuff and breccia may be cited as examples. In the 
quite type of igneous rock, the molten magma flows out quitely in all directions and 
solidifies. Rhyolite, basalt, andesite etc. are best examples of this type of rock. 
Fig. 19 : Landforms created by igneous rock 
Batholiths, Laccoliths, Dikes, and sills are the examples of the igneous rock formed 
into the interior of the earth (Fig. 19). 
Sedimentary rocks : The rocks which are formed by the deposition of sediments are 
known as sedimentary rocks. In this type of rock, the sediments are deposited in 
layers or strata. Sedimentary rocks cover an area of 5 per cent of the total area of the 
earth’s crust. However, about 75 per cent of the total exposed part of the continental 
landmass is formed of sedimentary rocks. 
Sources of sediments and their characteristics : Different types of mechanical and 
chemical weathering processes are acting on the earth’s crust. Due to the effect of 
these processes, the outer crust of the earth gradually erodes out. These eroded

materials are known as sediments. The sediments which are formed by detrital created 
by the mechanical weathering is known as clastic sedimentary rocks. Clay, sandstone 
and pebbles are the examples of clastic sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks which 
originate from the sediment accumulated by the chemical weathering is known as 
organic sedimentary rock. In this process, the materials which remain in soluble 
condition in the water gradually settle down at the bottom by different inorganic 
processes and ultimately become consolidated. For example, if evaporation occurs in 
any confined sea water, then the salts remain as residue. In this case, evaporation is an 
inorganic process and the salt that remains as residue is considered to be sediments. In 
some cases, the dead bodies of different acquatic animals are accumulated as organic 
sediments and ultimately these are consolidated and transformed into organic 
sedimentary rocks. Coal, limestone are the proper examples of such rock. Besides, 
dolomite, chert and gypsum are the examples of chemical sedimentary rocks. 
Classification of sedimentary rock : Primarily, the sedimentary rock is of three types 
viz., mechanical, chemical and organic. The names of sedimentary rocks with their 
elements is shown in Table 1.

Characteristics of sedimentary rocks : Bedding, ripple marks, clay, cracks etc. are 
found in the sedimentary rocks 
(Fig. 20). The presence of fossils is one 
of the major characteristics of the 
sedimentary rock. 
Metamorphic rocks : The rocks which 
through temperature, compression and 
chemical actions have been changed 
either in form or in composition is 
known as metamorphic rocks. 
																																																																													 Fig. 20 : Bedding of sedimentary rocks 
The agents of metamorphism : Heat, compression and chemically active fluids are 
the main agents who work singly or collectively to transform rocks. These 
metamorphic media increase the internal density of the rocks and the dimension of the 
crystals and create clear foliation. Due to the application of temperature and pressure, 
the minerals of the rock become compressed like the leaves of trees and are arranged 
in parallel layers. This characteristics of layered structure of rocks is called foliation 
(Fig. 21).

Examples of the important metamorphic rocks :

What we learnt from this chapter : 
Rocks are divided into three types according to their mode of origin, viz. (1) Igneous 
rocks, (2) Sedimentary rocks, and (3) Metamorphic rocks. 
The hot viscous type of matters in the interior of the earth is known as magma and if it 
finds its way to the surface of the earth, it is called lava. 
Igneous rocks : Igneous rocks are formed by cooling of magma. Landforms created 
by igneous rocks have diversified characteristics. Dikes, sills, laccoliths and batholiths 
may be cited as examples. 
Sedimentary rocks : Rocks which are formed by the accumulation of sediments is 
known as sedimentary rocks. In this type of rock, the sediments are accumulated in 
layers. Limestone, coral and gypsum are the examples of sedimentary rocks. 
Metamorphic rocks : Due to temperature, compression and chemical actions, the 
elements and structure of the minerals of a rock are changed and transformed to a new 
type of rock which is known as metamorphic rock. Igneous and sedimentary through 
changes are transformed to metamorphic rocks. 
Slate : Slate is formed from shale. It is used to produce writing slates and 
blackboards. 
Marble : It is a coarser grained crystalline rock which is created from limestone and 
dolomite. 
Quartzite : It is a very hard metamorphic rock. Primarily, it is formed of sandstone.

Changes of the Earth’s Crust 
Diastrophism 
The earth’s crust is ever changing. Different landforming processes are responsible to 
bring changes. Landforming processes are the activities by which the changes are 
accomplished naturally in the formation of the land. For example, a river is building a 
flood plain through deposition. So, the depositional activities of a river is a 
landforming process. The landforming processes are accomplished with the help of 
different physical agencies or forces such as the gravitational forces, interior 
temperature and the solar energy. The different landforming processes with the help of 
the aforesaid agents bring changes on the earth’s crust either slowly or rapidly. 
Generally, the landforming processes are associated with external forces. The changes 
brought about on the earth’s surface takes a longer period of time, so this type, of 
changes is known as slow changes. The slow changes are accomplished in two 
processes. 
Denudation : It means to make the things exposed. The processes by which the rocks 
on the earth’s surface are broken into pieces through the application of external 
physical forces and the debris are transported elsewhere is known as denudation. This 
denudation work is performed through three processes such as weathering, erosion 
and transportation. 
Weathering : The weathering is a process by which the rocks on the surface of the 
earth is broken mechanically into pieces due to snow or frost, the variation of 
temperature and pressure or due to chemical (dissolution) action on the materials. 
Even the rocks are dislodged by the animals. But the rocks weathered this way, are not 
transported elsewhere. 
Erosion : Erosion and transportation are accomplished together. The process by 
which the rocks of the earth’s crust are eroded by the river, wind, glacier, ocean 
currents etc. and the eroded materials are transported elsewhere is known as erosion. 
On the other hand, the rapid changes are brought about on the earth’s surface by the 
landforming processes associated with the internal forces. The changes brought about 
on the earth’s crust by the landforming processes are shown in a figure below : 
According to this figure, the earthquake and the volcanism are mentionable of the 
rapid and sudden forces responsible for the changes on the earth’s surface.

1. Earthquake : An earthquake is a vibration or oscillation of the surface of the earth 
caused by sudden release of enormous pressure. If a stone is thrown in the quite water 
of a pond, it will create ripples in the water which will scatter all around 
the pond. Sudden release of enormous 
pressure from the interior of the earth, 
creates waves in the surrounding rock like 
the waves in water which also scatter all 
around. The point where the energy is 
released is known as the centre. The point 
just vertically above the point of origin is 
known as Epicentre (Fig.22). Seismography 
is used to measure the intensity of the 
earthquake waves. 
Types of earthquakes : Normally, an earthquake originates between 5 to 1,126 
kilometres deep into the interior of the earth. The earthquake centre has been 
classified into three classes according to their depth. These are : 
Shallow : The earthquake originating at a depth of 60 kilometres is termed as shallow 
earthquake. 
Intermediate : The earthquake originating at a depth of 60 to 300 kilometres is 
known as Intermediate. 
Deep : The earthquake originating at a depth of 300 kilometres and above is known as 
deep earthquake. 
About 90 per cent of the earthquakes that occur throughout the year over the world 
originate within less than 100 kilometres of depth. The terrible earthquakes which 
occured so far over the world are mostly of shallow type. 
Causes of earthquake : The geologists opine that sudden tectonic actions in the 
faultline or along the cracks are responsible to create earthquake. Besides, sudden 
ejection of lava with great force can also produce earthquakes. Radiation of heat from 
the earth’s surface causes shrinkage which in turn to maintain equilibrium, develops 
cracks along the faultline or folds and the earthquake is caused. The rocks if dislodged 
due to earth movement or development of faults will also cause the earthquake. 
Fig. 22 : Focus and epicentre of earthquake
Lithosphere	 45 
Strength of earthquake : The energy of earthquake means the amount of strength 
which is scattered from the earthquake centre in all directions. Charles F. R. Richter, a 
seismologist first introduced an arithmetic scale to measure the intensity of seismic 
waves. The scale is known as the ÔRichter scale’. 
Earthquake Prone Areas or Belts 
From fig. 23, it can be realised that the severity of earthquake is not equal throughout 
the world. Earthquakes mostly occur in the comparatively smaller areas which are 
long and narrow in size. Among them, the most noteworthy areas are the circular 
islands (Philippines and Japan), young fold mountains and ocean ridges. According to 
fig. 23, the earthquake prone areas can be divided into three principal zones : 
(a) The Pacific Zone : Maximum number of earthquakes occur along the outer border 
of the Pacific Ocean. Japan, the Philippines, Chile, Aleutian islands and Alaska have 
been identified as the most earthquake prone areas. 
(b) The Mediterranean and the Himalayan Zone : This region extends from the 
Alps to New Zealand covering Caucasus, Iran, the Himalaya, Indo-China and East 
Indies following the northern coast of the Mediterranean Sea. 
(c) Ridges of the Mid-Atlantic and the Indian Ocean : The north-south ridges of 
the Mid-Atlantic Ocean meeting with the ridges of the Indian Ocean extends upto the 
Mediterranean zone through the Red Sea. 
Besides these three specified belts, there are some areas located seperately within the 
continents and in the deeps of the oceans where the occurrence of the earthquake is felt.

Fig. 24 : Volcano 
Effects of earthquakes : Earthquake is accepted as a natural calamity. Most of the 
times, it causes great loss of lives and wealth in some parts of the earth. 
Generally, it may be mentioned that the devastative nature of earthquakes brings the 
following damages and changes in the earth’s crust. 
(a) Faults, cracks or landslides occur in the earth’s crust due to the earthquake. The 
course of the rivers is also changed. For example, the bed of the Brahmaputra river 
was raised and the river changed its original course and started flowing through the 
channel of the Jamuna due to the earthquake of Assam in 1787. 
(b) Earthquake, if it occurs in a thickly populated area, then causes great devastation 
to houses, roads and railways, water and gas supply line and other properties of the 
area. Moreover, if the area is a hilly one, then the landslides and mud flow create 
devastation to the settlements located at the foot of the mountains. 
(c) Earthquake that originates in the ocean floor create tremendous waves on the 
surface of water. Waves thus created by earthquakes are known as Tsunamis. 
Tsunamis bring sudden flood in towns and other localities in coastal areas. 
2. Eruption : Eruption is one of the major forces or processes bringing changes on 
the surface of the earth. Eruption of the volcanoes or the magma is the main sources 
of igneous rocks on the surface of the earth. Volcanoes, by dint of their internal energy 
produce different landforms which are known as initial configuration of the land. 
Different weathering agents start erosion on these initial landforms with various 
external forces and such areas are gradually transformed into plain lands. Thus it can 
be noted that there are continuous attempts to maintain equilibrium between the 
internal and the external forces. 
Volcanoes 
Extreme temperature released from 
the radioactive minerals in the interior 
of the earth cause the rocks of the 
lower part of lithosphere to melt. This 
melted rock finds its way to the earth’s 
crust through the cracks or weak 
points. This erupted materials is 
known as Lava, gradually accumulated 
surrounding the vent and creates a 
high landform which is called Volcano 
(Fig. 24). 
On the crest of the volcano, there is a 
forepart with vertical slopes which is 
known as crater. This crater through a	 

Lithosphere	 47 
tunnel is linked with the magma in the interior of the earth. Sometimes the molten 
materials instead of ejecting out may be solidified inside. After ejection, the crater 
collapses creating a hole which is known as caldera. Crater lake of Oregon State of the 
United States of America is a Caldera. The volcanoes which eject lava from time to 
time are active volcanoes. At present, there are about 850 active volcanoes in the 
world. The volcanoes where volcanism remains suspended for a certain period of time 
are known as dormant and where the volcanic eruption has stopped permanently are 
known as extinct volcanoes. 
Erupted materials : Large number of rock fragments, volcanic dust and fine volcanic 
ashes are ejected with the lava. Besides, large amount of gaseous materials is also 
ejected. In the ejection process, firstly comes the basaltic lava followed by the 
andesite lava and lastly the rock fragments. 
Types of volcanoes : Though the nature of each volcanic eruption is quiet different, 
but the specialists on the basis of shape, size and eruptive nature have divided the 
volcanoes in three different types as Shield Volcano, Cinder Cone and the Mixed 
Cone. 
Shield volcanoes : This type of volcanoes is mainly constituted of basaltic lava. 
Mauna Loa and Kilauea of the Hawaii Islands are the best examples of this type of 
volcano. Mauna Loa is 5,000 metres wide beneath the ocean and it rises to 4,170 
metres above the ocean (Fig. 25). 
Fig. 25 : Shield volcano 
Cinder Cone : This type of volcano is created by rock fragments and lava. Parcutin 
and Mount Helena of Mexico are the proper examples of this type of Volcano. 
Mixed Cone : This type of volcano is created mainly by andesite lava which is fluid 
type with more viscous components. Hard rock fragments, volcanic dust, volcanic 
ashes and the heated gas are thrown with violent explosions and are accumulated near 

48	 Secondary Geography 
the crater and the viscous lava accumulates above them. Mount Maon of the Philippines 
and the Fujiama of Japan are the examples of this type of volcanoes (Fig. 26). 
Fig. 26 : Cinder and mixed cone volcanoes 
Volcano Prone Areas : The location of the active volcanoes have been shown in fig. 
27. Almost all the volcanoes are located along the border of the continents and the 
oceans. The main belt stretches from New Zealand in the Pacific to the southern tip of 
South America covering the Philippines, Japan, Alaska and the western coast of North 
America and this belt is known as Fiery Ring. Out of 850 active volcanoes of the 
world, this belt simply accounts for 75 per cent of the total. Moreover, traces of 
volcanic activities are also manifested in the submarine ridges of the oceans. For 
example, the landforming activities in the submarine ridges of Mid-Atlantic are still 
active.

Effects of volcanism : Volcanic eruptions and heavy lava flow are a kind of natural 
calamity which causes heavy damages to the living creatures and different human 
activities. In the past, many towns and settlements were destroyed by lava flows and 
thousands of people died instantaneously due to the release of poisonous gas from the 
volcanoes. Many of the volcanoes are situated in high mountainous regions and their 
crests always remain under heavy ice cover. But when eruption starts, the ice 
coverings melted and creates mud flow and creates heavy damages to the localities 
situated at the foot of the mountains. Moreover, occasionally the rock fragments and 
ashes ejected with explosive forces are being thrown into the air. 
The landforms that are created from the volcanic eruptions and lava remain unutilised 
for a longer period and brings noteworthy changes in the landscape. However, the 
landforms thus formed by volcanoes are very fertile and are also very rich in mineral 
resources. Moreover, the volcanic landforms are very important for tourists. 
Earthquakes 
What we learnt from this chapter : 
Earthquake : An earthquake is a vibration of the surface of the earth caused by 
sudden release of enormous pressure from the interior of the earth. 
Effects of Earthquake 
(a) 	Folds, cracks and landslides may occur and even the courses of the rivers is may 		 
be changed. 
(b)	Earthquake, if it occurs in any densely populated areas, will cause enormous 		 
damage to houses, roads and streets, water and gas supply system and other 		 
resources. 
(c) Earthquake, if occurs beneath the sea creates tremendous waves on the surface of 		 
the water. 
Volcanoes : The molten rocks of the interior of the earth finds its way to the surface 
through the cracks or weak points of the lithosphere. These ejected materials are 
known as lava which gradually accumulates in the surroundings areas of the cracks or 
openings and forms a high landform which is known as volcano. The volcanoes may 
be classified into three types viz, Shield volcano, Cinder cone and Mixed cone.

Landforms 
The earth is formed of diversified physical structures which is known as landform. 
These physical structures include the high mountains, vast traces of plain lands and 
also features of intermediate heights. The mountainous regions cover about 18 per 
cent, plateaus and hills about 24 per cent and the plain lands about 58 per cent of the 
total area of the earth. 
Mountains 
A mass of rock considerably very high occupying a vast area is known as a mountain. 
Higher altitude and steep slopes are its main characteristics. This altitude may reach to 
several thousand metres from the sea level. Some of the mountains may be located in 
isolation viz, the Kilimanjaro of East 
Africa. Again some mountains with 
several peaks may cover a large area 
(several thousand kilometres). This 
type of mountains are folded like the 
waves (Fig. 28) viz., the Himalayan 
Mountain which extends from Pamir 
Knot in the east. The Rocky and the 
Appalachian Mountains of North 
America, the Andes of South America, 
the Alps, the Ural, the Caucasus of 
Europe and the Fujiyama of Asia are 
noteworthy among other mountains.	 
Several mountain building processes known as Orogenesis work together in the 
formation of the mountain. Greek word ÔOros’ means mountain and ÔGenesis’ means 
formation or creation. Tremendous weathering particularly the wind, water and glacier 
bring substantial changes in the landforms. 
Types of mountains : The mountains can be classified into four groups according to 
their major characteristics viz., (a) Fold Mountain, (b) Volcanic Mountain, (c) Block 
Mountain, and (d) Laccolith Mountain. 
(a) Fold Mountain : This type of mountains are generally constituted with the union of 
several vast and high mountain ranges. It can be said easily that when a tectonic plate 
enters into another adjacent plate then huge quantity of sediments are accumulated 
52	 Secondary Geography 
Fig. 28 : Fold Mountain 
Mountain Peak 
Mountain Foot 
Rock 
Strata 
Mountain Peak
 along the joint line of the two 
plates and due to lateral pressure, 
these sediments are folded giving 
rise to anticlines and synclines. 
The fold mountains are formed 
consisting of the synclines and 
anticlines covering a vast area. 
The Himalayan Mountains, the 
Alps, the Ural and the Rocky 
Mountains are the appropriate 
examples of the fold mountains 
(Fig. 29).	 
(b) Volcanic Mountain : Generally, the volcanic mountains are formed by the 
accumulation and solidification of the molten materials ejected through the volcanoes. 
This type of mountains are 
generally conical is shape. 
Depending on the nature of lava 
flow ejected through volcanoes, 
this type of mountain in some 
cases, may cover small area with 
steep slope (Fig. 30) as Mount St. 
Helena of the United States of 
America, and in other cases, may 
cover a large area with gentle	 
slope like the Fujiyama (Japan) and the Mouna Loa (Hawaii island). 
(c) Block Mountain : The block mountain has got at least one side to be very steep 
with natural fault. Movement of the earth creates fractures in the earth’s crust. So, the 
rock strata on both the sides 
cannot match together and 
displacement starts among the 
strata. So, the earth’s crust is 
displaced along the crack 
which is known as fauly. So in 
some part, this displacement 
may be upward and in another 
part it may be downward. The 
uplifted part along the fault is

known as Block Mountain (Fig. 31). The Black Forest of Germany and the Salt 
Mountain of Pakistan may be cited as examples. The valley which is formed due to 
the downward movement of the land between two faults is known as the Rift Valley.	 
(d) Laccolith Mountain : The molten magma tries to come out of the interior of the 
earth being dispalced by the pressure of the gas, but these molten materials, instead of 
coming out to the surface of the earth 
solidifies beneath the surface of the earth’s 
crust. Due to upward thrust, the rock layer 
takes the shape of a tomb. The mountain 
thus formed is known as Laccolith or relict 
mountain (Fig. 32). The Henry Mountain 
of the United States of America is an 
example of this type of mountain. 
Plateau : The vast plain area lower than the mountain but higher in elevation than the 
plain land is known as Plateau. The formation of plateau is mainly linked with the 
mountain building processes (Fig. 33). 
The volcanic lava, in some cases, has 
formed a vast plain land as in the case of 
the Deccan Plateau of South India. 
Besides, the old mountainous regions, by 
the process of weathering and 
denudation has been converted into a 
plateau. According to the mode of 
location, the plateau may be classified into three types viz., (a) Intermontane Plateau, 
(b) The Piedmont Plateau, and (c) The Continental Plateau. 
(a) The Intermontane Plateau : 
The elevation of the Intermontane 
Plateaus range from 3000 to 5000 
metres. These plateaus are generally 
remain enclosed by mountains and 
are formed by the different 
mountain building processes. The 
Tibetan Plateau is of this type. This 
plateau is surrounded on the north 
by Kunlun, on the south by 
Himalaya and on the east and west 
by other mountain. The average elevation of this plateau is more than 4000 metres and 
the area is also more than 52 lakh square kilometres. Besides, the Bolivian Plateau of

South America, the Mexican Plateau of Central America, the Mongolian and the 
Tarim Plateau of Asia are examples of this type of plateau (Fig. 34). 
(b) The Piedmont Plateau : This type of plateau is formed at the piedmont of high 
mountains. Due to extensive weathering in the mountainous slope, the eroded 
materials are deposited in the lower slopes of the mountains creating an extensive 
plain land which is known as Piedmont Plateau. However, the lower part of this type 
of plateau joins with the adjacent plain lands. Colorado located in the south western 
tip of the Rocky Mountain of the United States of America and Patagonia of South 
America are the Piedmont plateaus. 
(c) The Continental Plateau : The vast high plain land enclosed by seas or lowlands 
are known as Continental Plateau. This kind of plateaus do not have any relation with 
the mountains. Arabian Peninsula, Spain, Australia, Greenland are the best examples 
of this type of plateau. 
The population is very thin due to rugged relief and dry clilnate. However, these 
plateaus are rich in different minerals like tin, copper etc. Moreover, hydroelectric 
plants have also been established in the rapid flowing rivers of the plateaus. 
Plains 
An extensive high land above the sea level with gentle slope is known as Plains. Here, 
the plain means the land which is less rugged. This type of plains have been formed 
by the erosional and depositional work of different landforming activities like river, 
glacier, and wind. Gently undulating land with less rugged relief is most suitable for 
agriculture, settlement and road construction. So, dense settlements have been 
developed on the plain lands. 
On the basis of the origin of the plain 
land, the plains have been classified into 
two as erosional and depositional. 
Plains formed by erosion : This type of 
plains are formed due to continuous 
erosion accomplished by river, wind and 
glacier. The upper rocks are eroded 
gradually and the lands with steep slope 
are transformed to plains (Fig. 35). The 
plains at the foot of the Appalachian and 
the Siberian plains are the glaring 
examples of this type of plains. Madhupur 
and Barind region are the two examples 
of such plains formed by erosion in

Bangladesh. During the Pleistocene era that means about 8 to 10 lakh years ago, 
these areas were uplifted from the ocean by diastrophic action. In the later eras, these 
uplifted areas had been transformed to plains due to erosional activities by river. 
Plains formed by deposition : The plains are also formed by deposition. Formation 
of this kind of plains can be found anywhere starting from the mountainous regions to 
the sea coast. Rivers during their course can form valley such as the valley of Nepal. 
Alluvial fan can be formed at foot of the mountain or hill by deposition. In the lower 
course of a river, when its transportation power becomes sluggish, it overflows the 
banks creating flood and the sediments are deposited gradually on both sides of the 
river forming a plain land which is known as Flood Plain (Fig. 36). Flood plains of the 
Dhaleswari and the Jamuna can be mentioned as examples. A type of plain land is 
formed at the mouth of the river through deposition which is known as Delta (Fig. 
36). The south western part of Bangladesh includes such a delta which is known as 
the Ganges Delta. Besides, the plains are also formed in the coastal areas due to the 
influence of ebb and tide are known as coastal plain (Fig. 36). The coastal plains of 
Chittagong stretching from the mouth of the Feni river upto Teknaf is an example of 
this type of plains. The plains are also formed by the deposition of glacial moraines in 
the cold areas. The Prairie of Canada is an example of such plains. 
 
Fig. 36 : Plains formed by deposition 
Sometimes, the plains can also be formed by the depositional work of the wind. The 
Loess soil of North China and the Pampa of Argentina are the examples of such 
plains. The Loess soil is very fertile but very much erosion prone.

Landforms 
What we learnt from this chapter : 
A mass of rock considerably higher than its surroundings occupying a vast area is 
known as mountain. The Mount Kilimanjaro of East Africa, the Himalayan Mountain 
and the Fujiama of Asia, the Rocky Mountain of North America are the examples of 
different types of mountains. 
Types : (a) Fold Mountain, (b) Volcanic Mountain, (c) Block Mountain, and (d) Laccolith 
Mountain. 
Plateau : An extensive flat elevated land lower than the mountains but higher than the 
plain land is known as plateau. According to their location, plateaus can be of three types 
viz., (a) Intermontane Plateau, (b) Piedmont Plateau, and (c) The Continental Plateau. 
Plains : An extensive area of level land of gentle slope usually of low altitude from sea 
level is known as plains. The plains are of two types such as (a) Erosional, and (b) 
Depositional.

Chapter Two 
Atmosphere 
The deep blanket of gas surrounding the earth is known as Atmosphere. The scientists 
opine that the atmosphere is about 35 years old. Its thickness is about 10,000 
kilometres. However, about 97 per cent of the total atmosphere remains confined 
within 30 kilometres upward from the earth’s crust. The atmosphere remains in 
contact with the earthÕs crust due to the gravitational attraction. Again due to the 
pressure of the layers of the atmosphere, density of air is highest at the sea level and 
decreases with height. 
Importance of the atmosphere : The atmosphere is of immense importance for the 
existence of the living organisms of the earth. The atmosphere safeguards the lives of 
living beings against the effect of harmful rays of the sun. Its gaseous elements like 
carbon dioxide rears the vegetation and oxygen safeguards the living creatures. The 
human activities on the surface of the earth helps to bring changes in the structure of 
the atmosphere, particularly large scale deforestation, industrial smoke, and burning 
of coal, mineral oil and the natural gas polluting the atmosphere. For the interest of 
the living beings of the earth, we should refrain ourselves from contaminating the 
atmosphere. So, we should have an idea about the structure of the atmosphere and 
how it works. 
Structure of the atmosphere : Atmosphere is constituted by the mixture of several 
gases. The composition of the atmosphere remains fairly constant roughly upto an 
altitude of 80 kilometres. Nitrogen and oxygen are the two important constituents of 
pure dry air. So far the volume is concerned, these two gases jointly constitute 98.73 
per cent and the rest of 1.27 per cent being occupied by other gases. A list of different 
constituent elements are presented below : 
Nitrogen (N2) 	78.02 % 
Oxygen (O2) 	20.71 % 
Argon (Ar) 	0.80 % 
Carbon dioxide (CO2) 	0.03 % 
Ozone (O3) 	0.0001 % 
Other 	0.4399 % 
	T otal 100.00% 
Other gases include helium, krypton, zenon, hydrogen, methane, and nitrous oxide. 
But the water vapour and dust particles are also found in different scale in the 
atmosphere. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is only 0.03 per cent. 
Atmosphere	 59
This meagre amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is much important for the 
atmospheric processes. Because, this gas helps the short waves of the sun’s rays to 
reach the earth. The short waves rays after coming in contact with the earth’s surface 
transform themselves to long waves. Carbon dioxide absorbs these long waves in the 
lower atmosphere. As a result, the atmosphere becomes hot. 
Atmospheric layers : The atmosphere can be 
divided vertically into four divisions according 
to the characteristics (temperature, pressure, 
density) of its different elements. These are 
Troposphere, Stratosphere, Mesosphere, and 
Thermosphere (Fig. 37). 
Troposphere : This is the lowest layer of the 
atmosphere and it remains in contact with 
the earthÕs crust. This layer is very much 
important for weather and climate. The upper 
limit of the troposphere instead of terminating 
suddenly, its characteristics gradually fade 
away and mix up with the next stratosphere 
layer. The last part of the atmosphere is 
known as Tropopause. The thickness of the 
troposphere is 8 kilometres in the polar region 
and 16 to 19 kilometres in the equatorial 
region. The characteristics of the troposphere are the following :	 
(a) 	The density and the temperature decrease with the increase of altitude. The 		 
decrease of temperature with increase of altitude is known as the normal lapse rate. 
(b)	The velocity of the wind increases with the increases of altitude. 
(c)	The lo wer atmosphere contains water vapour. 
(d)	The wind moves upward and downward. 
(e)	All sorts of weather and climatic processes are accomplished in this layer . 
Stratosphere : The next layer of the atmosphere is stratosphere which extends upto 
50 kilometres (Fig. 37). Maximum amount of ozone gas is available in this layer. This 
ozone layer absorbs maximum ultra violet rays of the sun. So, this earth has become 
suitable abode of the living creatures. Both density and pressure are comparatively 
less in this layer and the temperature also does not show a change in the lower 
atmosphere. However, from the 20th kilometre upwards, the temperature records a 
gradual rise and continues upto 50 kilometres in the high stratosphere. There is no 
water vapour in stratosphere. Stratopause exists above this layer. 
60	 Secondary Geography 
Fig. 37 : Atmospheric layers 
Mesosphere : The temperature decreases rapidly from the stratosphere upwards upto 
80 kilometres. This vast area is known as mesosphere. But the temperature again 
increases after the 80th kilometre. This layer is known as mesopause. Air pressure is 
very feeble in mesosphere. 
Thermosphere : Thermosphere extends upward from the mesopause. The lower part 
of the thermosphere is known as ionosphere. Above the ionosphere, there are other 
two layers such as exosphere and magnetosphere. 
Weather and climate : The daily average condition of temperature, pressure, wind, 
humidity and precipitation for any place is the weather. Generally, climate is the 
average condition of the weather for 30 to 40 years. 
Elements of weather and climate : The elements of weather and climate are : (1) 
Wind temperature, (2) Wind pressure, (3) Wind movement, (4) Humidity, and (5) 
Precipitation. 
Controls of weather and climate : The elements of weather and climate are 
controlled by the following factors. These are latitude, altitude, distance from the sea, 
location of the mountains, relief of the land, wind movement, ocean currents, slope of 
the land, soil and the forests. 
1. Latitude : This is one of the most important controls of climate as the incidence of 
sun’s rays varies with the latitude. The sun gives its rays vertically over the equator 
and as a result, the temperature is high in this region. On the other hand, the higher 
latitudes receive inclined or slanting rays and hence the temperature is low. Generally, 
the atmospheric temperature decreases from the equator towards the poles. 
2. Altitude : The atmospheric temperature decreases with the increases of altitude. 
There is a decrease of temperature of 6° Celsius for every 1000 metres of increase of 
altitude. Though two places being situated on the same latitude, but their climate will 
differ due to the difference in altitude. As for example, Dinajpur and Shillong though 
located on the same latitude but the climate differs due to the variation in altitude. The 
temperature in Shillong is much lesser than that of Dinajpur. 
3. Distance from the ocean : The climate of a place becomes mild if it is located 
nearer to the sea or ocean. As the climate of Cox’s Bazar, Chittagong and Patuakhali 
is milder than that of Bogra being situated nearer to the sea. No remarkable variation 
of temperature between winter and summer and between days and nights is found in 
the coastal regions. This type of climate is known as equable climate. But the regions 
away from the coastal area experiences extreme climate during winter and summer, 
because the landmass gets warmer as well as colder more quickly than that of the 
waterbodies. For this reason, the interior parts of the continent during summer become 
very hot and equally these become very cold during winter. This type of climate is 
known as the continental climate or extreme climate. 
Atmosphere	 61
4. Wind movement : The wind movement plays an important role on the climate of a 
place. If any wind blows saturated with water vapour, then this may cause abundant 
rainfall there. During the rainy season, the monsoon full of water vapour brings heavy 
shower in Bangladesh. Again during the winter season, the continental air brings no 
rainfall in Bangladesh and the temperature decreases. 
5. Ocean currents : The air of the coastal area becomes either cold or warm due to 
the influence of cold or warm ocean currents. As for example, it can be mentioned that 
the eastern coast of the United States of America records an increase of temperature 
due to the influence of the Warm Gulf Stream. Again, the cold Labrador Current keeps 
the eastern coast of North America cold. 
6. Location of the mountains : Wind movement, when obstructed by the high 
mountains, can create influence on the climate. The monsoon air being obstructed by 
the athwart situation of the Himalayan mountain in the north, brings heavy shower in 
Bangladesh, India and Nepal. On the other hand, during winter the cold airmass of 
Central Asia cannot cross the Himalayas and so the climate of the sub-continent never 
gets cold like Europe. 
7. Slope of the land : The air and the land become heated where the sun’s rays fall 
directly on the slopes of the high lands. But to the opposite side of the slope, the air 
remains cold due to the inclined or feeble sun’s rays. 
8. Soil : The structure of soil or its texture play a vital role in the preservation of 
temperature. The sandy soil of the uncovered areas becomes hot as well as cold 
quickly. But in comparison to sandy soil, the alluvial and the clayey soil take much 
time to become either warm or cold due to heat preservation capacity. 
9. Location of the forest : The vegetation by its evapo-transpiration activity helps the 
air to be saturated with water vapour, and this saturated air being condensed brings 
rainfall. Besides, the intensity of storms, and cyclones are reduced being obstructed by 
the forest. The air of the dense forest remains comparatively cold as the sun rays 
cannot penetrate the dense to heat the soil. 
Insolation and Air Temperature 
Variation in insolation : The atmosphere receives 99.97 per cent of its total energy 
from the sun. The energy thus received from the sun is transformed as heat energy or 
energy of motion in the atmosphere. The amount of energy received from the sun by 
the earth through radiation in the form of small waves is the insolation. During 
transmission, a considerable amount of this energy is absorbed, scattered and reflected 
by the atmosphere. In the clear sky, about 80 per cent of this energy can reach the 
earth through the atmosphere and the rest of 20 per cent is lost in the space. Even the 
total energy that the earth receives from the sun is not distributed equally throughout 
the world. The amount of energy received by the equatorial region, in comparison to 
62	 Secondary Geography
this, loses less amount of energy. On the other hand, the condition is just the opposite 
in the polar regions, in other words, the polar regions lose more energy than what they 
receive. The solar energy tries to bring equilibrium of this unequal distribution of 
insolation through the wind movement and the ocean currents. 
The controlling factors of insolation : The amount of insolation that any portion 
of the earth’s surface gets in a day will depend on two factors viz., (a) The intensity of 
insolation depends on the verticality or the inclination of the sum’s rays, (b) Duration 
of the day in comparison to night and the solar radiation. With the changing positions 
of the sun, the above two factors act seperately from the equatorial region to the poles 
in different latitudes and in different seasons. 
In figure 38, it is observed 
that the intensity of the 
vertical rays is greater as 
it passes through a 
comparatively thinner layer 
of atmosphere and it 
concentrates in a smaller 
area. The different latitudes 
lying between the Tropic of 
Cancer and the Tropic of 
Capricorn get vertical rays 
at noon. On the other hand, 
the oblique solar rays pass 
through a thicker layer and 
it covers a larger area. Due to these two reasons, the intensity of solar rays during 
summer is more than that of the winter. Again the intensity of morning and afternoon 
rays is less than that of the noon’s rays.	 
The earth’s crust gets sufficient time, if the day is long, to receive more solar energy 
and consequently both the earth’s crust and the atmosphere become warm. On the 
other hand, if any place, the nights are longer, then that place remains cold as it 
receives less amount of insolation due to short duration of day time. 
Air temperature : The warmth and the coldness situation of the atmosphere is the air 
temperature. The sun’s rays or the solar energy is the major reason for such warmth or 
coldness of the atmosphere.

Transformation of temperature between the earth’s crust and the atmosphere : 
Temperature is transferred between the earth’s crust and the atmosphere by three 
processes. These are radiation, conduction and convection. 
Radiation : Electromagnetic waves can transfer energy (both temperature and light) into 
two objects without any medium. The same process also occurs in case of solar energy. 
Sun rays of a fixed wave length reaches the earth penetrating the atmosphere through 
this process. Again by radiating heat through this process, the earth becomes cold. 
Conduction : This is a process by which heat can be transferred through a close 
contact. In this way heat is transferred from one part of an object to another. The crust 
of the earth becomes heated by the process of transference of heat. 
Convection : The heated particles transfer heat from hot areas to the cold areas 
through the process of convection. This process is also found to occur in case of liquid 
and gas. In this case, the liquid or gas becomes lighter being heated and rises up and 
the surrounding cold liquid or gas occupies the vaccum space. The temperature of the 
atmosphere is transferred this way. 
So, the sun’s rays through radiation, after penetrating the atmosphere, reaches the 
earth’s surface. Through conduction, the earth’s surface is heated and by convection, 
there is a exchange of temperature between water and the atmosphere. 
Distribution of temperature : Due to the influence of latitude and altitude, the 
temperature of different places differ in different seasons. There is a change of 
temperature of any locality due to diurnal and annual motion of the earth. Besides, 
variation of temperature occurs due to wind movement. 
So, though the temperature differs in different places, yet we get an average 
distribution pattern of seasonal temperature throughout the world. Isotherms are used 
to show the distribution of average temperature. The imazinary lines joining the points 
of equal temperature on a map is known as Isotherm. The isotherms show the 
temperature of all points or the average for many days or several months of a year for 
any particular time. The horizontal distribution of temperature of the earth for the 
months of January and July is shown by isotherms (Fig. 39). With the change of 
season, the highest temperature is also changed in the northern and southern 
hemispheres. For example, the lowest and the highest temperature is recorded in the 
month of January and July respectively in the northern hemisphere. But during that 
time, completely, opposite condition prevails in the southern hemisphere. 
Air Pressure 
Like any other matter, the air has its own weight. The pressure of the air thus created 
due to the weight of the air is known as air pressure.

Pressure Belts 
Due to the variation of temperature in different latitudes and the rotaion of the earth, 
several pressure zones have been formed at the lower layer of the atmosphere which 
are known as pressure belts (Fig. 40). 
1. Equatorial Low Pressure Belt : This Equatorial Low Pressure Belt occupies an 
area lying on both sides of the equator extending from 0° to 5°. This region receives 
vertical sun’s rays throughout the whole year. The air pressure is low over this region 
as the air in comparison to its surrounding areas is hot and light. Moreover, this region 
has more waterbodies. As a result, low pressure which is known as Equatorial Low 
Pressure Belt has been formed. 
1. Tropical High Pressure Belt : 
More the equatorial hot, humid and 
light air goes up, more it becomes cold. 
Thus warm air continuously rises up but 
it cannot come down in the equatorial 
zone. As a result, the upper air starts 
moving towards north and south. In this 
way, the upper cold and heavy air starts 
coming down in the tropical region 
between 25° to 30°. Thus two heavy 
pressure belts are formed in the mid 
region between 25° to 35° North and 
South latitudes. These two pressure 
belts are known as the Tropical High 
Pressure Belts (One over the Tropical of Cancer and the other one over the Tropic of 
Capricorn). 	 
3. Subpolar Low Pressure Belt : The rotational force of the earth at two polar 
regions is very high. As a result, the wind of these two regions moves towards the 
tropics. During that time, the pressure of the wind decreases at two arctic regions 
(between 60° to 70° latitudes) creating two low pressure belts. These two are known 
as Subpolar Low Pressure Belts. 
4. Polar High Pressure Belt : The wind nearer to the two poles is very cold and 
heavy due to the location in the cold regions. So, two high pressure belts have been 
formed at two polar regions. These two are known as Polar High Pressure Belts. The 
wind from these two high pressure belts moves towards the subpolar low pressure 
belts.

The value of pressure is shown as milibar (mb). At the sea level, this pressure of the 
air is about 6.7 kg. per 6.45 square centimetres. The pressure of the wind decreases 
with the increase of altitude. Sea level height is internationally accepted as zero (0) 
height to measure the air pressure. The pressure of the wind is measured by an 
instrument known as Barometer. The lines joining the places on a map having equal 
average pressure is known as Isobar. The air moves from high pressure area towards 
low pressure area. 
Due to difference in temperature and pressure the air moves from one part of the earth 
to another. This movement of the air is known as wind. The wind has certain specific 
characteristics as follows : 
1. 	The cold and heavy air moves from the areas of high pressure to low pressure area. 
2. 	According to Ferrel ’s Law, the air moves towards right in the northern hemisphere 	 
	and to wards left in the southern hemisphere. 
The wind system of the earth can be divided into four types. These are Planetary 
wind, Seasonal wind, Local wind, and Irregular wind. 
Planetary wind : These winds being controlled by the pressure belts, blow towards 
the same direction throughout the whole year. The planetary wind is of three types 
such as : the trade wind, the westerlies and the polar wind. The planetary wind system 
has been shown in fig. 41. 
The trade wind : The sun’s rays fall vertically over the equatorial region, so the air 
becomes hot and goes upwards. Since the pressure is less upward, the rising air gets 
room for expansion and consequently the air becomes cool and dense. The cool air 
could not come down directly due to warm air at the bottom. As a result, the air moves 
towards north and south directions through the upper atmosphere. Moving upto 30° 
latitudes some part of this air finds its way to come downward and blows towards the 
equatorial low pressure belt. This part of the air is known as the Trade Wind. 
According to Ferrel’s Law, the trade wind blows from north-east in the northern 
hemisphere and south-east in the southern hemisphere. The trade wind of northern 
hemisphere is known as North-East Trade Wind and that of southern hemisphere as 
South-East Trade Wind. The sky remains clear and the weather is hot and dry as this 
trade wind originates in the high pressure zones. The big deserts of the world are 
situated nearer to this area. For example, the Sahara desert, the Lybian desert, the 
Arabian desert in the northern hemisphere and the Kalahari desert in the southern 
hemisphere can be mentioned. 
Atmosphere	 67
Fig. 41 : Planetary wind 
The Westerlies : Some part of the air from 30° latitude blows towards the poles over 
the surface of the earth and after reaching 60° latitude faces the cold and dense air 
coming from the poles. So, comparatively the warm and light air from the tropical 
areas rises above the dense cold polar air and a part of it blows towards the polar low 
pressure belt. This is known as West Wind. In the northern hemisphere, it blows from 
south-west and in the southern hemisphere from north-west. As the area of the 
landmass is greater in the northern hemisphere, so locally, some changes occur in the 
air motion. However, in the southern hemisphere, the maximum area is covered by the 
waterbodies and hence the west wind can move uninterrupted. The velocity of the 
westerlies reaches at the highest between 40° to 47° South latitude. This region is 
called Roaring Forties. This air movement is known as Brave West Winds. Two more 
airmasses regularly move from north and south polar high belts towards the subpolar 
lows. These are known as north-east and south-east polar winds. In this, the 
circulation of planetary wind system (the trade, the westerlies and the polar) exists 
between the equator and the poles. 
Temporary wind : The wind which is caused due to the difference of temperature of 
land and water occurring during at specific time of the day or during a particular 
season of the year is known as temporary wind such as : the monsoon, the land and 
the sea breezes. 
The Monsoon : In Arabic ÔMonsoon’ means season. The most important characteristics 
of this wind is the changes in the wind direction with the seasons. The monsoon is also

a regional air. This mainly prevails in south and south-east Asia. Besides, that the 
monsoon is also observable in North Australia, part of Africa and in the United States of 
America. During summer a low pressure is formed due to excessive heat along the midlatitudes 
or in the north-west of the Indian sub-continent. Hot and moist air from the 
adjacent oceans blows towards the continent. According to Ferrel’s Law, after crossing 
the equator this wind is transformed into the south-west monsoon. This wind being 
obstructed by the high mountains, causes heavy shower on the land. 
During winter the interior part of Asia remains very cold and so there creates a high 
pressure cells. The cold air blows from the north-east high pressure area of the 
landmass towards the low pressure zone of the ocean. As this air originates in 
landmass, it is dry and it doesn’t contain any water vapour. This is why the Central 
and South Asian regions remain dry in winter. However, when this blows over the Bay 
of Bengal it acquires great amount of water moisture and ultimately causes shower to 
the coast of Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu. This air, however, when crosses the equator 
according to Ferrel’s Law blows over North Australia as the north-east monsoon and 
acquires large amount of water moisture from the Indian Ocean causing heavy shower 
to northern Australia. 
Land and Sea Breezes : In the coastal regions, the temperature of local landmass 
increases with the advancement of the day and a low pressure is established locally 
and comparatively the cool air from the adjacent sea blows towards the land (Fig. 42). 
Atmosphere	 69 
Fig. 42 : Land and sea breezes 
This is known as sea breeze. The velocity of this air reaches to its maximum in the 
afternoon. The air blows from the high pressure zone formed over the ocean towards 
low pressure area over the landmass as the temperature in the afternoon increases. 
After the sun set, the landmass cools quickly in comparison to the ocean. During that 
time, the high pressure prevails over the landmass. So, the air moves from the high 
pressure area formed over the landmass towards the ocean (Fig. 42). This is known as 
the Land Breeze. 
Local Wind : The wind which is created due to the difference in diversity of 
landscapes and in temperature is known as local wind. There are about several 
hundreds of such local winds such as the valley and the mountain breeze. 
Valley and Mountain Breeze : A special type of wind movement is found to occur in 
the mountainous regions due to the relief of the land. During the day time, the sides of 
the mountains become more warmer 
in comparison to the bottom of the 
valley. As a result, the high pressure 
prevails at the bottom of the valley 
and low pressure on the sides of the 
mountains. The wind which is found 
to rise upwards along the slopes of 
the mountains during day time is 
known as valley wind (Fig. 43). 
During night time, the slopes of the 
mountains cools down due to 
radiation. At this time, the valley 
floor remains comparatively hot. 
So, the cool and heavy air comes 
down the slopes of the mountain. 
The wind which during night time 
moves along the slope of the 
mountains towards the valley floor is known as the mountain breeze (Fig. 43). 
Irregular Wind : In some places, the air pressure decreases and low pressure is 
formed due to high temperature. Again, high pressure is localised in some places due 
to much coldness. The wind movements thus formed is known as Irregular Wind such 
as : cyclones and anti-cyclones. 
Atmospheric Humidity and Precipitation 
Humidity is the amount of water vapour present in the air. The humidity of the air can 
be expressed in two ways such as, absolute humidity and relative humidity. Absolute 
humidity refers to the amount of water vapour per unit volume of air. 
On the other hand, relative humidity represents the amount of water vapour actually 
70	 Secondary Geography 
Fig, 43 : Valley and mountain breeze 
present in the air (absolute humidity) compared with on the other hand, relative 
humidity is the ratio of the amount of water vapour actually present (absolute 
humidity) in the air to the amount of water vapour required to saturate the same 
amount of air at a given temperature and pressure. 
The humidity of the air mainly depends on the water vapour. The air receives the 
water vapour through evaporation of water from the open waterbodies (sea, rivers and 
small waterbodies) as well as from vegetation. 
The air is said to be saturated when at a particular temperature, the air cannot absorb 
more water vapour. 
If the air starts cooling it cannot hold the water vapour it had, then some of the water 
vapour is transformed into water particles. This is known as condensation temperature 
at which the water vapour is condensed is known as Dew Point. 
If the temperature is 0° Celsius or remains below freezing point, then the water vapour 
becomes hard and falls on the earth’s surface as ice crystals or snow. But if the 
condensation temperature or dew point remains above the freezing temperature then 
the water vapour after condensation becomes dew, fog or rains. 
Snow : In the cold regions, if the temperature falls below the freezing point then the 
water vapour of the air condenses like the carded cotton and falls on the earth. This is 
known as snow. 
Dew : After radiating the temperature, the earth’s crust gets cold at night. The 
atmospheric stratum adjacent to the earth’s crust also becomes cold coming in contact 
with the cold earth. So, the water vapour containing capacity of the air is also 
decreased and hence the extra amount of water vapour which the air cannot carry is 
transformed to water and rest on the earth as water drops. This is known as dew. In the 
cold regions when the temperature of the earth’s crust goes below the freezing point 
then the dew is condensed to frost. 
Fog : In the winter season due to close contact with earth crust, the temperature in the 
lower atmospheric strata is decreased. Consequently, centering the dust particles of 
the air, condensation starts in the lower strata of the atmosphere which is ultimately 
transformed to tiny water particles. These water particles remain in the air in a 
floating state. This is known as fog. 
Rainfall : Saturated air going up becomes cool and condensed and transformed into 
cloud. A cloud contains innumerable water and ice particles. These water and ice 
particles coalesce together to form a bigger size of water particles which due to 
gravitational force fall on the earth’s surface as rain. The rainfall is of four types such 
as : convectional, orographic, cyclonic and frontal. 
Atmosphere	 71
Convectional rain : In the low pressure 
region, the air being heated goes high into 
the atmosphere and expands. So, it easily 
cools down. The rainfall which is caused 
due to condensation of the water vapour is 
known as Convectional rain (Fig. 44). 
The rising air, in the equatorial low 
pressure zone, contains plenty of water 
vapour and on condensation causes regular 
Convectional rain there.	 
Orographic rain : The moistureladen wind is forced to rise up the slope of the 
obstructed mountain, is cooled down 
and on condensation causes rain on the 
windward side of the mountain. This 
type of rainfall is known as Orographic 
rain (Fig. 45). No rainfall is found to 
occur on the other side of the mountain 
as the air remains dry. This side is 
known as Leeward Slope. The southwest 
monsoon being obstructed by the 
hills of Meghalay gives abundant 
orographic rain in Sylhet.	 
Cyclonic rain : The air from the centre of the cyclone rising upward becomes cool. 
At this moment, the excess water vapour of the air condenses and causes rainfall. This 
type of rainfall is called as Cyclonic rain. 
Frontal rain : When the cold and warm airmasses meet together, then it coming in 
contact with cold air, the temperature of the warm air decreases and reaches the 
condensation level. This condensation is deepened and gives rain in the conflict area. This 
is known as Frontal rain (Fig. 46). This type of rain is found in the temperate regions.

Monsoon Climate 
Characteristics of the Monsoon : It has been discussed earlier that the monsoon is a 
seasonal wind in which there is a complete or almost complete reversal of wind 
direction. Along with the change of direction of wind, there is also a change in the 
characteristics of the monsoon wind. Due to the reversal nature of the wind direction, 
the winter remains dry and abundant rain comes in summer. The air is dry in winter as 
it originates in the landmass. During winter season, the monsoon wind starts blowing 
from the landmass and while crossing ocean it absorbs moisture and brings abundant 
rainfall on the landmass it comes across. The winter monsoon causes rainfall in the 
north-east coast of Sri Lanka, in the coast of Tamil Nadu, in West Japan and in the 
east coast of the Philippines. The summer monsoon, as it blows from the ocean 
towards the landmass, carries sufficient moisture with it. As a result, heavy shower 
occurs. It is due to the effect of the monsoon, that the variation of temperature is less 
between the winter and the summer in the low latitudes. However, the intensity of 
winter is well felt in the mid-latitudes. During this time, the cold continental airmass 
can reach the mid-latitudes. The mid-latitudinal regions come under the influence of 
tropical airmass in summer. So, hot weather prevails there (Fig. 47). 
	
	H = High Pressure 	L = Lo w Pressure 
Fig. 47 : Monsoon winds movement and pressure of South and South-East Asia 
Geographical locations of the Monsoon : Most of the monsoon regions are located 
in Asia, particularly in South and South-East Asia. The vastness of Asia, the situation 
of the Himalayas and the location of the warm water in south-eastern part create great 
difference in temperature between the landmass and the waterbodies. This difference 
of temperature is the cause for the formation of the monsoon. 
The monsoon climate of South and South-East Asia covers India, Bangladesh, 
Pakistan, Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia and the 
Philippines. Besides, the monsoon climate is also found to prevail in China, Taiwan, 
Japan, Korea and the northern coast of Australia. 
Monsoon climate of South Asia : Three seasons are found in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, 
Pakistan and India due to the influence of monsoon climate. These are : 

74	 Secondary Geography 
1. Winter season : From October to the end of February. 
2. Summer season : From March to the end of May. 
3. Rainy season : From June to the end of September. 
Among the three seasons, the rainy season is most important. The pattern of monsoon 
wind system of winter and summer has been shown in fig. 47. The air blows from the 
land to the ocean in winter and from the ocean to the land in summer. South Asian 
countries experience more or less rainfall in all the seasons in different localities. But 
about 80 per cent of the total rainfall occurs in the rainy seasons. The winter season in 
this region starts to prevail just after the rainy season. The durability and intensity of 
winter differs with the variation of the regions. As for example, the intensity of winter 
is moderate in central Bangladesh and is simply unbearable in northern India during 
the same period. Temperature shows an increase from March and reaches to the 
maximum in May. A low pressure develops during this period over the area causing 
the maritime air to blow towards this region. By June this maritime air reaches the 
landmass with its fullest intensity and in this way the Ôburst of the monsoon’ starts 
which brings the rainy season. 
The Monsoon Climate of South-East and East Asia : The winter monsoon of 
South-East Asia is influenced by the Siberian airmass and so it is cold and dry. The 
wind first blows towards the east and then takes a turn towards the equatorial region. 
As this wind blows over the ocean, it causes abundant rain in the western coast of 
Japan, in the Philippines, and in South China. Due to the formation of the low 
pressure in Central Asia during summer (May to September), the air from the adjacent 
oceans starts to blow towards East and South-East Asia. Consequently, it gives rain 
first in South-East Asia and later in East Asian countries. 
Importance of the Monsoon : The impact of monsoon is very much important in the 
agricultural sector, particularly in South and East Asia. The crop calendar of these 
regions is mostly controlled by the monsoon climate. For example, the agriculture of 
Bangladesh is hard hit by drought if monsoon rain does not start in time and if the 
rainfall is not in required quantity. 
Atmosphere 
What we learnt from this chapter : 
The coverage of the air which surrounds the earth is known as atmosphere. 
Atmosphere is formed by the mixture of different gases. The main two constituent 
elements of fresh and dry air is nitrogen and oxygen. 
The atmospheric layers are divided into four divisions such as : Troposphere, 
Stratosphere, Mesosphere and Thermosphere. 
Weather and climate : The weather is a daily average condition of atmospheric, 
temperature, pressure, rainfall, humidity, and the air movement for a certain place. 
Again the climate is the average condition of weather for 30 to 40 years.
Atmosphere	 75 
Solar energy : The amount of energy received by the earth through radiation in the 
form of small waves is the solar energy. The solar energy is transformed through the 
process of radiation, conduction and convection. 
Air movement : Due to difference in pressure and temperature, the air moves from 
one part of the earth to another. The movement of air is known as the wind. The wind 
moves from high pressure to low pressure zone. The wind system of the earth is 
divided into four types. These are Planetary wind, Seasonal wind, Local wind and 
Irregular wind. 
Land and sea breeze : In the coastal areas with the advent of the day, the temperature 
of the air over the landmasses is increased. So, to neutralize the pressure, cold and 
dense air from the sea starts blowing over the land. This is known as sea breeze. 
Just after the sun sets, the temperature over the landmass cools down quickly. But at 
that time, the ocean remains comparatively warm. So, the air blows from the land 
towards the sea. This is known as land breeze. 
Rainfall : The moistureladen air goes high into the sky and cools down and is 
transformed into cloud. The cloud contains innumerable water and ice particles. These 
water and ice particles coalesce together to form a bigger size of water particles. So, 
by the gravitational attraction of the earth, these water particles fall on the earth as 
rain. Rainfall can be divided into four types such as : Convectional, Orographic, 
Cyclonic and Frontal.

The Hydrosphere 
Definition : The hydrosphere is the mantle of water which covers the lower parts of 
the surface of the globe. The hydrosphere covers 71 per cent of the surface of the 
globe. Its area is about 36.25 lakh square kilometres. 
The hydrosphere is formed of oceans, seas, gulfs, lakes etc. The great stretch of open 
water is known as Ocean, the smaller areas less than ocean are the seas. The open 
stretch of water surrounded on three sides by land is the bay while the gulf is 
surrounded by land almost on all sides. The lakes are the stretches of water 
surrounded by land. 
The Oceans 
There are five oceans in the world. These are : the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, 
the Indian Ocean, the Arctic Ocean and the South Ocean. Of these, the Pacific is the 
largest ocean having an area of 60 crore and 60 lakh square kilometres. The average 
depth of the Pacific is the highest being about 4,270 metres. The Atlantic Ocean is the 
second largest ocean having an area of 8 crore and 24 lakh square kilometres although 
its place is third in respect of average depth. There are many semi-circles seas in the 
Atlantic having indented coastline. The Indian Ocean is about 7 crore and 36 lakh 
square kilometres in area and its average depth is 3,962 metres. The Arctic Ocean or 
the North Ocean surrounds the north pole. The southern part of this ocean is 
surrounded nearly all over by North America and Eurasia. The North Ocean is 1 crore 
and 50 lakh square kilometres in area and the average depth is 824 metres. The South 
Ocean is 1 crore 47 lakh square kilometres with average depth of 149 metres (Fig. 48).

78	 Secondary Geography 
Definition of the ocean currents : The movement of water in a regular and fixed course 
from one part of the ocean to another gives rise to ocean currents. 
Causes of the ocean currents : The causes of the flow of the ocean currents are 
mentioned below : 
1. 	Wind movement; 
2. 	Difference of temperature; 
3. 	Difference of salinity; 
4. 	Difference of evaporation; 
5. 	Variation in depth; 
6. 	Rotation of the earth; 
7. 	Location of the landmass. 
Fig. 48 : Location of ocean in the world 
1. Wind movement : The strong and regular wind blows over the surface of the ocean to 
a particular direction. So the wind system is the major cause of the ocean currents. In the 
belts of the Trade Winds, ocean currents flow from the east to the west while in the 
westerly wind belts they flow from the west to the east (Fig. 49). 
HYDROSPHERE 
°
The Hydrosphere	 79 
Fig. 49 : Impact of wind on ocean current 
Fig. 50 : Impact of evaporation and salinity 
in sea water 
2. Difference of temperature : The 
temperature of the surface water of the 
ocean is different in different latitudes. 
Strong heat in the equatorial and 
tropical regions causes the water to 
become warmer which in turn results in 
the expansion of the water in volume 
and thereby the water becomes lighter 
and the density also decreases. But in 
upper and mid-latitude regions, the 
water is heavy due to less heat. The hot 
and light water in the equatorial regions 
flows poleward as warm surface 
currents while the colder water from the 
poles creeps as under currents to fill the 
vaccum.	 
3. Difference of salinity : Density of 
water depends on the salinity. Water 
becomes lighter with the decrease of 
salinity while the water becomes 
heavier with the increase of salinity. 
Light water flows as surface currents 
while the heavy water flows as under 
current (Fig. 50). 
4. Differences of evaporation : Much 
evaporation occurs in the hot regions of 
the ocean resulting in the decrease of 
water level. Comparatively cold water 
from the neighbouring less hot areas of 
the ocean move towards more hot areas 
to maintain equilibrium in the ocean 
water. 	 
5. Variation in depth : The shallow ocean water becomes hot and light very quickly 
that causes up-rise of the warm water resulting in a downward flow of the cold water 
current to occupy the place of the warm water. As a result, of the upward and 
downward movement of the ocean water as currents are created.
80	 Secondary Geography 
6. Rotation of the earth : The earth rotates from west to east. As a result, the ocean 
currents are deflected to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the 
southern hemisphere. 
7. Location of the landmass : Landmasses deflect the flow of ocean currents 
resulting in the formation of a new course. It is, for example, due to the Cape of Saint 
Rock in the east of Brazil that the South Equatorial current in the Atlantic Ocean is 
divided into two branches. One is flowing through the north coast of South America 
and the other through south-east coast. 
Various ocean currents : The ocean water does not remain stationary in one place. 
The water of all the oceans and seas are flowing either as surface or under current. 
Hence, the ocean currents are divided into three on the basis of the location of the 
oceans. These are : 
(a) 	The Atlantic Ocean Currents; 
(b) 	The Pacific Ocean Currents; 
(c) 	The Indian Ocean Currents. 
The Atlantic Ocean Currents : The continents of Europe and Africa are in the east 
of Atlantic while North America and South America are in the west. The equator has 
divided the Atlantic Ocean into north and south part. So, the currents can be divided 
into two parts. 
A. 	South Atlantic Ocean Currents; and 
B. 	North Atlantic Ocean Currents. 
A. South Atlantic Ocean Currents 
1. The Antarctic Current : The cold waters from the Antarctic move under the 
influence of the strong westerly wind from west to east. This is known as the 
Antarctic current and it enters into the Atlantic by the south of South America. 
2. Benguela Current : The branch of the Antarctic current being deflected near the 
Cape of Good Hope turns to the north and flows by the west side of South Africa. 
This current is known as the Benguela current. The current is cold since it comes from 
the cold current. It turns westward under the influence of the south-east trade winds 
and joins the South Equatorial current. 
3. South Equatorial Current : The South Equatorial Current originates from the 
extended part of the Benguela current. This current marches towards north-west upto
The Hydrosphere	 81 
the equator being influenced by the rotation of the earth and the south-east trade 
winds. This current is known as the South Equatorial Current as it flows to the south 
of the equator. This is warm current. 
4. Brazil Current : The branch of South Equatorial current known as Brazil current 
which flows through the east coast of Brazil to the south-west. The current is warm 
since it originates from the warm current and flows through the tropical region, 
crossing the Tropic of Capricorn, the current turns eastward gradually under the 
influence of westerly wind and meets the Antarctic current. 
5. Falkland Current : A branch of the Antarctic current on entering the Atlantic 
Ocean turns north and flows northward along the coast of Falkland Island and 
Argentina. This is known as Falkland Current and it is a cold current. 
B. North Atlantic Ocean Currents 
1. North Equatorial Current : The warm currents flowing from east to west along 
the north of the equator under the influence of the rotation of the earth and the northeast 
trade winds is known as the North Equatorial Current (Fig. 51). This is warm 
current. After crossing the Mid-Atlantic, the northern branch of the South Equatorial 
current meets the North Equatorial current. The North Equatorial current is divided 
into two branches. The first branch flows into the Gulf Stream taking a turn to the 
north. The second branch flows first into the Carribean Sea and then into the Gulf of 
Mexico. 
2. The Equatorial Counter Current : Between the North and South Equatorial 
currents, there is a weak current flowing from west to east is known as the Equatorial 
Counter Current. This is a warm current. 
3. The Gulf Stream : The Gulf Stream, practically, has originated from the extended 
part of South and North Equatorial currents. This mixed current enters into the 
Carribean Sea and is divided into two branches being obstructed by the islands. One 
of the branches enters into the Gulf of Mexico. The rush of water from the Mississippi 
river of the United States of America enhances the speed of this current and flows 
through the narrow strait of Florida to North Atlantic. It is known as the Gulf Stream 
since it has originated in the Gulf of Mexico. The extent of the Gulf Stream varies 
from 64 to 80 kilometres at the entrance of Florida strait, the depth is 914 metres, the 
average speed is 8 kilometres per hour and the temperature is 30° Celsius. The colour 
of the current is deep blue.
82	 Secondary Geography 
Fig. 51 : Current of Atlantic Ocean 
At the Mid-Atlantic, the depth and the temperature of the current comes down while 
the width gets increased and this current flows here at a speed of 2.5 kilometres per 
hour. While flowing north-east along the east coast of the United States of America, 
the Gulf Stream is divided into three branches at the mid of the North Atlantic due to 
the influence of the westerlies. 
(a) 	North Atlantic Stream; 
(b) 	West Greenland Current; and 
(c) 	Canaries Current.
The Hydrosphere	 83 
(a) North Atlantic Stream : The first branch of the Gulf Stream being called North 
Atlantic Stream flows along the coast of West Europe, the British Islands and Norway 
into the North Sea as a warm current. 
(b) West Greenland Current : The warm West Greenland current, the second branch 
of Gulf Stream curving northward proceeds along the south of Iceland and Greenland 
and then flows through Davis Strait between Greenland and Baffin Island to the north. 
(c) Canaries Current : The third branch of Gulf Stream known as the Canaries 
current turning southward flows along Portugal and the west coast of West Africa. The 
current is divided into two branches. The first branch curving south-west under the 
influence of Trade Wind flows into North Equatorial Current. This is a cold current. 
4. Guinea Current : The Guinea current, the second branch of Canaries Current, 
flows along the coast of Guinea of West Africa to the south upto the Equator. Then 
joining the Equatorial Counter Current, it flows into the Bay of Guinea. This is a cold 
current. 
The flow of different currents and cross currents along the sides of North Atlantic 
Ocean has caused in the centre of the ocean an area of stagnant sea often full of drifted 
branches of plants, grass, sea-weeds etc. and is called the Sargasso Sea (Fig. 51). 
5. Labrador Current : Two cold currents from the North Ocean flows along the east 
and west of Greenland into the Atlantic Ocean. These two currents join in the north of 
Labrador Peninsula and taking the name of the Labrador Currents. It flows along the 
east coast of Newfoundland and the United States of America to the south. The 
Labrador current flowing south to New York gets deflected by the warm Gulf Stream. 
The deep blue water of the Gulf Stream and the green water of the Labrador flow side 
by side in the opposite direction and the border of these two cross currents is called 
the Cold Wall. 
The impact of ocean currents on trade 
1. The ocean water in the mid-tropic and high tropic region freezes in winter. 
Naturally the mercantile ships cannot ply in those seas. But the warm current keeps 
the sea ports ice free where it enters the sea. This makes possible the free trafic of the 
commercial ships in the seas.
84	 Secondary Geography 
2. A ship can sail to a port of destination in a short time in favour of the current but it 
takes a lot of money, energy and time if the ship goes against the current. 
3. It is safe to sail ships in the passage of the warm currents. Cold currents bring 
icebergs. The ships are damaged if hit by an iceberg and sinks into the ocean. This 
way the Titanic ship sinks into the Atlantic Ocean. 
4. The icebergs that come floating with the cold current are quickly melted and the loads 
such as pebbles, sand, mud etc. are deposited on the sea bed creating shoals. Plenty of 
fish food is available in these shoal areas, and as such are good for fishing ground. 
Hydrosphere 
What we learnt from this chapter : 
Hydrosphere : The hydrosphere is the envelope of water which covers about 71 per 
cent of the surface of the earth. It covers an area of 36 crore and 25 lakh square 
kilometres. 
The land and waterbodies : The water area covers 71 per cent and land area covers 
29 per cent of the total area of the surface of the earth. 
The Oceans : The wide open mantle of water is called the Ocean. There are five 
oceans in the world namely, the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, 
the North Ocean and the South Ocean. 
The area of the Oceans : The Pacific Ocean is 16 crore and 60 lakh square 
kilometres, the Atlantic Ocean is 8 crore and 24 lakh square kilometres, the Indian 
Ocean is 7 crore and 36 lakh square kilometres, the North Ocean is 1 crore and 50 
lakh square kilometres, and the South Ocean is 1 crore and 47 lakh square kilometres. 
The Ocean Currents : The movement of water from one part of the ocean to another 
in a regular and fixed course is known as ocean current. 
Ocean currents are of three types (1) The Atlantic Ocean Current, (2) The Pacific 
Ocean Current, and (3) The Indian Ocean Current. 
Warm current generally flows as surface current, while the cold current moves as 
under current. 
The causes of Ocean Currents : The wind system, the difference of temperature 
depth, salinity, evaporation, rotation of the earth and location of land area cause ocean 
currents. Of these factors, the wind system plays a vital role to create ocean currents. 
South Atlantic Ocean Currents : The South Atlantic Ocean currents flow towards 
left (leftward or anti-clockwise). The Antarctic current, Falkland current, Benguela 
current, South Equatorial current, and Brazil current flow into the Atlantic Ocean. 
The Hydrosphere	 85 
Among all these currents, the Antarctic current, Falkland and Benguela currents are 
cold currents and others are warm currents. 
North Atlantic Ocean Current : The currents of the North Atlantic Ocean are 
flowing towards right (southward or clockwise). The North Equatorial Current, the 
Gulf Stream, North Atlantic Stream, West Greenland Current, Canaries current, 
Guinea Current, Labrador Current, and Equatorial Counter Current are the principal 
currents of the North Atlantic Ocean. The Labrador, Canaries, and Guinea currents are 
cold currents. 
There are different currents and cross currents on the sides of North Atlantic Ocean 
and in the whirlpool of water in the centre, there is no current resulting in the deposit 
of moss and drifting weeds in the stagnant water. This is called the Sargasso Sea. 
The impact of the Ocean Currents : The seas in the high latitudes are frozen during 
winter and the mercantile ships cannot ply. Naturally, the commercial transactions are 
disturbed in the ports during winter on the high latitudes. But the seas where warm 
currents flow do not freeze in winter and mercantile ships can move freely. There are 
possibilities for the ships to get damaged by the icebergs that the cold currents bring.

Regional Geography 
A region is a wide area having some universally accepted homogeneous character. 
The purpose of the regiorn concept is to distinguish similar regions making them clear 
and well arranged from adjacent regions on some particular basis. The term ÔregionÕ is 
of course, used in a wide sense. Regions are classified into different types such as, 
physical region, political region, cultural region etc. Hill, mountains, plateaus, plains, 
rivers, lakes, seas are studied in the physical regions. All these are gifts of nature 
having no roles for human beings to play. On the other hand, the political regions 
(Fig. 52) are the borders of different countries and soverign area of government. The 
cultural region is based on culture of human beings. In the same manner, industrial 
region is the accumulation of a number of man-made factories that produce a number 
of products. So political regions, cultural regions and industrial regions are based on 
particular ideas.

Chapter One 
The Continent of Europe 
Location : The continent of Europe is located between 35° to 71° North latitude and 
25° West longitude to 66° East longitude. 20° East longitude and 55° North latitude 
has passed the middle of the continent. The continent has the North Sea to its north, 
the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea to its south, the Caspian Sea and Asia to its east 
and the North Atlantic Ocean to its west. The Ural mountain has seperated Europe 
from Asia. 
Area : Europe ranks third among all the continents in respect of its area. The area of 
Europe is only 2,32,27,496 square kilometres. It is about 0.24 part smaller than Asia 
in area, 0.35 part of Africa, 0.43 part of North America and 0.59 part of South 
America while it is 1.37 times larger than Australia and 7.45 times larger than 
Antarctica. 
Coastline : In comparison to its size, Europe has a very long and broken coastline. 
The coastline is 41,204 kilometres i.e.1kilometre of coastline for every 242 kilometres 
of its area. In many places, there are inland, seas and bays and gulfs so that no part of 
Europe is more than 1,690 kilometres from the sea. This has resulted in the formation 
of many natural harbours and ports along the coast. There are many peninsulas, 
islands archipelagoes along the coast of this continent. In the north coast, the majors 
ones among others are White Sea, Bothnia Peninsula, Baltic Sea, North Sea, Iceland 
Island, Scandinavian Peninsula (Norway and Sweden) and Denmark Peninsula. 
Besides, there are Novaya Zemlya and Pittsburgen Island, North Cape and Northkin 
Cape. In the west coast, there are Bay of Biscay and the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and 
Portugal). In the south coast, there are Mediterranean Sea, Gulf of Genoa, Tyrrhenean 
Sea, Adriatic Sea, Ionian Sea, Aegean Sea, Sea of Marmara, Black Sea, Azov Sea, 
Balearic group of Islands, Corsica Islands, Sardina Island, Sicily Island, Italian 
Peninsula, Ionian Archipelago, Balkan Peninsula and Crimean Peninsula. As the 
continent of Asia is located in the east, there is only Caspian Sea surrounded by land 
on all sides. 
Physiography : Europe is divided into four divisions on the basis of its physical 
structures (Fig. 53). 
1. The Rocky Plateau of North-West Europe; 
2. The great plain of Central Europe; 
3. The plateau of Central and West Europe; and 
4. The mountainous lands of South Europe.
90	 Secondary Geography 
1. The Rocky Plateau of North-West Europe : The Scandinavian Peninsula 
(Norway and Sweden), the northern part of Scotland and Ireland are included in this 
region. In the past, this region was consisted of old metamorphic rocks. Owing to their 
long exposure to the external agents of denudation, these ancient rocks have been 
worn down to form plateau. The Kiolen mountain is in the north Scandinavian plateau 
and the Dover Field mountain is in the south. The landmass of this region slopes to 
the south-east. The rift valley of Glenmore has divided the Scotland plateau into two 
parts. The north part of the United Kingdom is known as the Scottish Highland, while 
the southern part is Graspian range of mountains. Nevis (1,344 metres) of Graspian 
mountain is the highest peak in the United Kingdom. 
2. The Great Plain of Central Europe : This great plain stretches from the coast of 
the Bay of Biscay in the west to the eastern border of Europe in the east. In fact, this 
plain has joined the plains of Asia and formed the greatest plain in the world. The 
plain includes North France, Belgium, Netherlands (Holand), Germany, Poland, 
Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukrain and most of the places of Russia. 
The surface in this plain is mostly flat and in most cases is not more than 152 metres 
above sea level. Much of the surface of the lowlands is covered by glacial deposits 
and moraines because the glaciers moved over this area. 
Fig. 53 : Physiography of Europe
The Continent of Europe	 91 
3. The plateau of Central and West Europe : The region is formed of five small and 
big diffused plateaus. This region includes Meseta plateau of Iberia, Central Meseta 
Plateau of France, Bavaria, Plateau of Germany and Bohemia Plateau of Czech and 
Slovakia. 
4. The Mountainous Lands of South Europe : The Alps Mountain is situated at the 
central place of this mountainous lands. The Alps Mountain is about 1,116 kilometres 
long and in width it varies from 56 to 64 kilometres. A number of branches from this 
mountain have spreaded to the different directions of South Europe. The Dinaric and 
Pindus mountain in the south-east of Balkan Peninsula, Balkan mountain in the east of 
the Dinaric, the Republican of Czech and Slovakia to the east of the Alps, the 
Carpethian mountain covering West Ukraine and the central east of Romania, the 
Transylvania mountain in South Romania, the Caucasus mountain, Jura mountain and 
Vosges mountain to the east of Black Sea are all determining the border of France, 
Switzerland and Germany. The Evergen and the Siveneze mountains are located in 
South France. The Mount Blank (4,807 metres) situated in the border of South-East 
France and Italy, is the highest peak. This peak remains under ice throughout the year. 
The Meseta plateau of Spain is situated in the highlands of Pyrenees in the border of 
France and Spain, in the highlands of the Cantabrian Mountain in North Spain and the 
Sierra Nevada in South Spain. The Apennines, a branch of the Alps has passed 
through Italy towards south. 
The Hungary Plain is located in the river valley of Daniube within the Carpethian and 
the Dinaric Mountains, the Lombarde Plain in between the Alps and the Apennines, 
and the Romania plain between the Balkan and the Transylvania mountains. Visuvius 
of Italy, Etna of Sicily, Strombly of Lepery Island and Hekla of Iceland are the notable 
volcanoes of Europe. 
Climate : Europe is situated at the Temperate Zone. Difference in climate is found to 
occur in different places of Europe due to the distance from the sea, influence of warm 
currents, location of the Arctic circle, and the mountains etc. On the basis of the 
mentioned situations, the climate of Europe is divided into four climatic regions (Fig. 54). 
1. The Tundra Climatic Regions : This climatic region is included in the Frizid zone 
as the northern parts of Norway, Finland and Russia being situated in the north of the 
Arctic circle, and this type of climate is known as the Tundra Climate. The winter 
season is long and the intensity of winter is very high. There is a heavy snowfall in 
this season and the surface remains covered with snow for about nine months of the 
year. 
2. The Temperate Climate of North-West Europe : The countries in this region are 
those located along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean in the north-western Europe that 
include Norway, southern part of Sweden, Germany, France, northern part of Spain, 
92	 Secondary Geography 
Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, the United Kingdom and Iceland. The 
climate of this region is equable as the warm North Atlantic Stream flow along this 
region and no place is far off from the ocean. The amount of rainfall is higher more 
during winter but the intensity of winter cold is not much. 
Fig. 54 : Climatic region of Europe 
3. The Continental Climate of East Europe : This climatic region include Poland, 
Southern Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, 
Armenia, and Azerbaijan of East Europe. The region is far from the sea. The cold 
wind of the north blows over these countries. The intensity of cold during winter is 
very high. It rains a little under the influence of westerly wind during summer, but in 
the east the rainfall gradually decreases. So the climate of this region is called 
Extreme Continental Climate. 
4. The Mediterranean Climatic Region : This region includes Portugal, South 
Spain, South France, Italy, Albania, Greece, the European Turkey, the Mediterranean 
Islands, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily and Crete of South Europe not far from the 
Mediterranean Sea. Though there is scorching sun during summer but the temperature 
remains less due to the influence of the sea. The intensity of cold during winter is not 
felt high. There is rainfall in winter but the summer goes dry.

The Continent of Asia 
Location : We live in the continent of Asia. Bangladesh is located in this continent. 
Asia lies between 10° South latitude to 80° North latitude and 25° East longitude to 
170° West longtitude. The Pacific Ocean is in the east of this continent, Europe and 
the Mediterranean Sea in the west, Africa and the Red Sea in the south-west, the 
North Ocean in the north while the Indian Ocean in the south. Europe and Asia are 
jointly called Eurasia since they are connected by land. Only the Ural Mountain, the 
Ural river and the Caspian Sea have seperated Europe from Asia. 
Area : Asia is the largest continent of the world. Its area is 4,64,91,180 square 
kilometres. This continent is 8,528 kilometres from north to south while in east to 
west it is 9,654 kilometres. The continent of Asia is 1.5 times larger than Africa, 1.82 
times than North America, 2.4 times than South America, 4.19 times than Europe, 
5.73 times than Auatralia and 3.12 times than Antarctica. 
Fig. 56 : Continent of Asia in the world map 
Coastline : The coastline of Asia is not very much indented. Naturally, the coastline is 
much shorter in comparison to its area. The total coastline is 57,924 kilometres that 
means it has 1 kilometre coastline per 773 square kilometres. The number of the 
developed sea ports is much less since the coastline is very short. 
Physiography : Asia can be divided into five divisions according to its physical 
structures.
The Continent of Asia	 99 
1. The low plains of North Asia : If we draw a straight line from the Bering strait to 
the south of the Caspian Sea, we shall see a great low land to its north. This plain has 
gradually sloped to the north. 
2. The highlands of Central Asia and the mountains : The height of Pamir, a 
plateau in Central Asia is 4,813 metres and it is called the Ôroof of the worldÕ since it is 
the highest plateau. The plateau is called the Pamir Knot, because different mountain 
ranges radiate from Pamir Knot to different directions. The Tien Shan Mountains have 
stretched towards north-east direction from here. Of the ranges of this mountain, Altai, 
Yablonovy and Stanovoi are the major ranges. The Karakoram lies in the south-west 
of the Kunlun running towards east from the Pamir and the Himalayan Mountains in 
the south (Fig. 57). The Tarim plateau is situated between the Altyntag Mountains and 
the Tien Shan and the plateau of Tibet lies between the Himalayan Mountain and 
Kunlun. The Himalayas is the highest mountain in the world. It is about 2,414 
kilometres long and 241 to 402 kilometres wide. The Mount Everest (8,884 metres) is 
the highest peak. 
Fig. 57 : Physiography of Asia 
Besides, there are about 22 such peaks whose height will not exceed 6,016 metres. K2 
or Godwin Austin (8,619 metres) of Karakoram Mountain is the second highest peak 
in the world. Few branches from the east end of the Himalayas turning towards south 
passed through Myanmar as the Arakan Yomas and Pegu Yomas.

Two mountain ranges viz., Hindu Kush extending towards south from Pamir Knot and 
the other one towards south-west as Sulaiman and Khirthar. The Elburz mountain of 
north Iran and the Zagros mountain of south Iran have joined the Armenian Knot to 
the west. The Iranian Plateau is located in between these two mountains. The 
mountains of Pontic and Taurus originating from the Armenian Knot extend towards 
west. The plateau of Anatolia is between these two mountains. 
3. The low plains of South Asia : The deposits of alluvial soil by the rivers of Tigris 
(Dazla) and Euphrates (Forat) basin of Iraq, Indus-Ganges-Brahmaputra basin of 
Pakistan, India and Bangladesh and Hwang Ho-Yangtze-Sikiang basin of China have 
developed this plain. Tigris and Euphrates plain slope towards south-east, the Indus 
basin towards south-west, the Ganges basin towards east, the Brahmaputra basin 
initially towards south-west then towards the south. The alluvial soil has made this 
plain very fertile. 
4. The Plateau of South Asia : The Arab, Deccan and Indo-China plateau of the 
southern part of Asia is formed of old rocks. Most of the area of the wide Arab Plateau 
is barren and sandy and this plateau slopes to the east. The West Ghat Mountain is 
situated to the west of the Deccan plateau, East Ghat Mountain in the east and 
Vindhya range in the north. This plateau slopes to the east while the Indo-China 
Plateau slopes to the south. 
5. The Volcanic Islands : Forming ÔfestoonsÕ down the east coast of Asia, there are 
rocky islands of Aleutian, Kurile, Japan, Riukieu, the Philippines and Borneo. Most of 
these islands are adorned with volcanoes. 
Rivers : According to the flow, the four great river systems of Asia are as follows : 
(a) Rivers flowing to the North Sea : The Obb (with tributary Irtish 5,569 
kilometres) and the Yenisey (with tributary Angara 4,989 kilometres) rising from the 
Altai Mountains and Lena originating from the lake Baikal (4,264 kilometres) flow to 
the North Sea. The mouth of the rivers remain frozen most of the time of the year. 
(b) Rivers flowing to the Pacific Ocean : The Amur river (4,344 kilometres) 
originating from Yablonovy Mountain has flowed to the Orkhotosk Sea in the east. 
This river remains frozen for six months of the year. The Hwang Ho (4,668 
kilometres) rises from the Kunlun Mountains and has fallen into the Yellow Sea. The 
Yangtzekiang (5,525 kilometres) originating in the Tibet Plateau has fallen into the 
East China Sea. Yangtze is the longest river in Asia. The Sikiang rises from Yuanan 
Plateau of China and flows to the South China Sea. The Mekong river and the Menam 
both rise from the Tibet Plateau, have fallen into the South China Sea and to the Bay 
of Thailand respectively. 
(c) Rivers flowing to the Indian Ocean : The Salwin (2,816 kilometres) river of 
Myanmar originating from the Tibet Plateau has fallen into the Bay of Martaban. The 
Irrawaddy (2,092 kilometres) rises from the Naga Mountains and flows through 
Myanmar falls into the Bay of Martaban. The Brahmaputra (2,896 kilometres) rises 
from lake Manash of Tibet and mingles with the Ganges flows through Tibet, Assam 
The Continent of Asia	 101 
and Bangladesh. The Ganges (2,505 kilometres) rising from the glacier ÔGangotreeÕ 
flows to the Bay of Bengal through India and Bangladesh. The lower part of the river 
is known as the Padma. The Indus (2,896 kilometres) rises from the Himalayas and 
flows to the Arabian Sea through Kashmir and Pakistan. The Tigris (Dazla, 1,900 
kilometres) and the Euphrates (Forat) rise in the highlands of Armenia in East Turkey. 
The combined course of these two rivers is known as Shat-el-Arab and flows into the 
Bay of Persia. 
(d) Rivers flowing into the lakes : The Amudarya and Sirdarya rising from the Pamir 
plateau and Tien Shan mountain respectively fall into the Aral Lake, while the Ural 
river, coming up from the Ural mountains flows to the Caspian Sea, the Tarim river 
(2,735 kilometres) to the Lapnor Lake from the Karakoram Mountains, the Helmond 
river from the Hindu Kush mountains to the Hamun and the Jordan river from the 
highlands of Lebanon to the Dead Sea. Besides, many small rivers from the different 
parts of the continent of Asia have flowed to different directions. 
Climate : Asia, being a large continent, has diverse physical features. The barriers to 
the free flow of air current have created different climates in different areas. 
According to the prevailing climate, the continent can be divided into seven climatic 
zones (Fig. 58). 
1. Equatorial Climatic Zone : The equatorial type of climate is found in Singapore, 
Malaysia Peninsula and Indonesia within 5° North and 5° South latitudes. The 
termperature here is high and heavy shower occurs throughout the year. The variation 
of temperature between winter and summer is less. 
Fig. 58 : Climatic region of Asia
102	 Secondary Geography 
2. The Monsoon Climatic Zone : The countries in the Tropical zone and the eastern 
part of Asia are included in this climatic zone. The countries included are South and East 
China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh, 
India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. Heavy rains occur during summer and the rains make the 
summer cooler. Neither summer nor winter is extreme here. The climate is warm and 
wet. 
3. The Desert Climatic Zone : The prominence of dryness in this type of climate is 
the major characteristics. Less growth of vegetation is found here due to no rainfall or 
less rainfall and the prevalence of drought. This type of climate is divided into two. 
(a) Hot Desert Climatic Region : This climate includes the Thar Desert of Pakistan 
and India, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and 
South-West Iran. Here the climate is extreme. Extreme hot during day and very cold 
during night is found to prevail here. 
(b) Cold Desert Climatic Region : This type of climate includes Mongolia of Central 
Asia, Sinkiang of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, 
Afghanistan, and Iran. These regions experience less rainfall being far away from the 
ocean. The air of this region is dry due to less amount of rainfall. The climate of this 
region is cold due to height. The Gobi desert is located in Mongolia and Sinkiang of the 
cold and dry climatic region. 
4. The Mediterranean Climatic Zone : This climatic zone includes Turkey, Syria, 
Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, and North Iraq of West Asia. Here rain falls in winter and 
the summer goes dry. 
5. The Continental Climatic Zone : The climate of West Siberia is extreme. Winter 
is very cold here and there is heavy snowfall. Summer is hot but short. There is 
scarcely any rainfall. 
6. The Cold Temperate Climatic Zone : This climate is found in East Siberia. 
Winter is extreme here. Extreme cold wind flows from the Arctic in winter. There is 
snowfall instead of rainfall. The eastern part is colder and drier than the western part. 
7. The Tundra Climatic Zone : This climate is found in the north of Siberia. Winter 
is very long here and cold is very extreme. Verkhoyansk in Siberia is the coldest place 
in the world. The snow in the north of Tundra does not melt even in summer. This area 
is unfit for human habitation.
The Continent of Asia 103 
Political division and population : The states of Asia have been divided into five 
regions for the sake of discussion such as (1) The SAARC countries, (2) South-East 
Asia, (3) Far East and Siberia, (4) Central Asia and (5) South-West Asia. The area 
under SAARC, a forum for the development of South Asia regional countries is 
52,21,391 square kilometres and more than 159.90 crore people live hi this region. All 
the seven states are independent and sovereign and help each other for mutual 
development. 
There are 11 states in South-East Asia with a total area of 45,10,560 square kilometres 
and population of 59.70 crore. Each of the states is independent and sovereign. 
There are 8 states in the Far East and Siberia. The total area of these countries is 
2,65,71,415 square kilometres with a total population of 158.01 crore. 
The total area of five countries in Central Asia is 39,94,400 square kilometres and the 
population is 6.25 crore. 
The total area of the 16 states of South-West Asis is 61,93,414 square kilometres and 
the population is 29.36 crore. 
The Soviet Union broke up in 1991 creating 15 sovereign states. Of these, the 
countries included in Asia are (1) Siberia (the part of the Republic of Russia in Asia), 
(2) Kazakhstan, (3) Uzbekistan, (4) Turkmenistan, (5) Tajikistan, and (6) Kyrgyzstan. 
In 1993 some parts of Israel in the Middle East have been given self-rule status in the 
name of Palestine.

Chapter Three 
Malaysia 
Introduction : Malaysia has been formed of the southern part of South-East Asian 
Peninsula and Sabah of Borneo Island and Sarawak. The Malay Peninsula is West 
Malaysia and Sabah and Sarawak is East Malaysia. 
Malaysia is one of the friendly countries of Bangladesh. The people of this country 
freed themselves from the foreign rule and supremacy and then they have accelerated 
the pace of economic development by their untiring toil. Bangladesh is rapidly 
expanding her economic co-operation with this country. 
Location : The South China Sea is in the north of Malaysia, Celebis Sea in the east. 
Java Sea in the south and the Isthmas of Malacca in the west. The country is located 
between 2° South latitude to 8° North latitude, and 100° East longitude to 120° East 
longitude. 
Area and inhabitants : Malaysia is a country having an area of 3,29,750 square 
kilometres. The total population of Malaysia is 2.89 crore and density of population is 
79 per square kilometres. The state language is Malay. People of different religious 
beliefs such as, Islam, Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Taoism, Sikh, Bahai, 
Hinduism live in this country. However, the majority is Muslims. 
Fig. 59 : Political division of Malaysia
110	 Secondary Geography 
Physiography : Malaysia is formed of coastal plains while the central region has high 
plateau. There is a narrow plain in the east and west coast of Malaya Peninsula, while 
the plains in the south coast is relatively broader. The southern part of the western 
coast of Sarawak is quite broad and the northern part becomes narrower gradually. 
The northern part of Sabah is a wide plain. There are only a number of plain lands of 
considerably large size in mountainous or hilly Malaya Peninsula. The principal 
mountainous water-shed is located near the west coast. Some of its parts are more 
than 2,100 metres high. There are many mountain ranges parallel to the coastline. 
The land in the western part of the principal water-shed is undulatory and fertile and 
has been developed considerably. But the eastern part of the same water-shed is forest 
covered mountainous land and less developed. The principal mountain ranges of the 
Malaya Peninsula are extended from north to south and is mainly formed of granite 
rock. But some of the mountains in the east are formed of quartzite and shale. 
However, there are some regions formed of limestone with steep flank in the west of 
the peninsula. The small basins formed of new rocks are found here and there. One of 
such basins can be found near Kuala Lampur. 
Fig. 60 : Physiography of Malaysia 
The regions of Sabah and Sarawak of North Borneo may be divided into three parts 
such as (1) the coastal plains, (2) the piedmont regions, and (3) the hilly regions. 
Alluvial soil has formed the coastal plains and small hills have made up the piedmont 
regions. The coastal plain is formed of alluvium and the piedmont region is formed of 
parallel mountain ranges extending from north to south have gradually elevated to a 
height more than 1,805 metres. The Kinabalu mountain is 4,050 metres high.
Malaysia	 111 
Climate : Malaysia is located in the north of the equator. Naturally, the climate is 
equatorial and rain falls the whole year round and most of the rainfall occurs in the 
form of convection rain. Although located in the equatorial region, Monsoon blows 
over this country. 
The North-East and the South-West Monsoon bring rain in both the seasons of winter 
and summer. The eastern coast of Malaysia is under the direct influence of North-East 
Monsoon and hence wet season prevails from November to March and flows strongly 
over the neighbouring seas. Average rainfall in most of the areas of Malaysian Islands 
is 2,540 millimetres. The amount of rainfall increases in some open areas upto 6,860 
millimetres but in the covered valleys, the rainfall comes down to 1,524 millimetres. 
The average temperature varies from 25° to 27° Celsius. In the low lying areas, the 
average temperature is around 27° Celsius throughout the year. 
Fig. 61 : Windflow of Malaysia 
The west coast of Malaysia is under the influence of Indian Oceanic South-West 
Monsoon. The wet season lasts from May to September. The western part of Malaysia 
remains partly outside the direct influence of the wind as Sumatra Island stands as a 
barrier to the flow of South-West Monsoon. As a result, the strait of Malacca located 
between the Island of Sumatra and Malaya Peninsula remains relatively calm. For 
this, it has actually accelerated the economic growth of this region. The change of the 
direction of the windflow occurs during the months of April and October. 
Average temperature in the north coastal area of Sabah remains at 27° Celsius. Two 
seasons prevail there one during October to April when there occurs heavy rainfall under 
the influence of North-East Monsoon, the other one during May to September when 
relatively dry weather prevails. January and February are the time for heavy rainfall.
112	 Secondary Geography 
Natural vegetation : Natural vegetation of Malaysia is dense and evergreen. This 
forest extends from sea plain to the high mountains. There is huge aquatic mangrove 
forest in the west coast plain of Malaya Peninsula and a narrow ring ÔCassiua BinaÕ 
tree of tamarisk group in sandy shore of east coast. 
In the equatorial forest of this country, the tall, straight and branchless trees of 
different species have a dense growth. About 50 per cent of the trees have a height of 
more than 30 feet. The big trees grow up with a canopy of thick leaves which the rain 
can penetrate but no sunlight ever reaches the ground. As a result, the land under these 
trees gets less light like twilight. Under the canopy of thick leaves, there is the under 
growth of creeper-like plants as well as bamboo and cane. 
Since in the equatorial forest, 
trees of different species have 
dense growth, one cannot 
find many trees of a certain 
species at a particular place. 
So, it is very difficult to 
collect a great number of tree 
trunks of a particular species 
and many trees are destroyed 
while bringing the trunks out 
of the forests. It is an 
economic loss. The valuable 
hard wood trees like Iron 
wood, Rose wood, Ebony, 
Mahogany and Rubber are 
procured from the forest of 
Malaysia and besides Palm, 
Bamboo, Malayan cane, 
Malaccan cane are also 
collected. But the plants of 
commercial use are not 
available in abundance in 
such a natural environment of 
the forest. 
Agriculture : The agricultural 
system in Malaysia is divided 
into (1) Indigeneous system of 
agriculture and (2) Arable 
agriculture system. 
Rice grows in the west coast valleys and east coast of the peninsula. The farmers grow 
rice just to meet their own need. Malaysia imports three eigths (3/8) of its total need 
of rice from abroad. Besides, the farmers grow tobacco, camphor, sago, spices, coffee, 
cocoa, tea and tapioca. There is little farming in the areas far from the coast and 
valleys. Some of the areas of the forest are inhabited by backward ÔSemangÕ, an

aboriginal tribe who are not used to farming. The Malaysians live mainly in the 
village. The extensive progress in the cities is carried out by the Chinese. 
Rubber plantation started in Malaysia in 1895 as an arable system of Agriculture. 
Rubber is produced commercially in the big farms. Rubber plantation is practised in 
30 lakh acres of land mainly in the low hilly regions and low plains of the west coast. 
Fig. 63 : Landuse in Sabah and Sarawak 
The trees having big trunks are cut down and other plants are burnt to prepare lands 
for rubber plantation. Steps have been taken carefully so that soils are not washed out. 
In fact, some other temporary plants 
are used as cover to check soil erosion. 
Rubber cannot be collected from the 
trees less than 7 years old. One is to 
wait several more years to get good 
quality of rubber. Rubber production in 
Malaysia has got much importance due 
to the location of the gardens just in 
the vicinity of the coast, improved 
transport system, no impact of tidal 
water, easy availability of labour force, 
fast transportation of rubber products 
to the ports, abundant demand of 
rubber outside the country etc. Fig. 64 : Rubber collection from tree
114	 Secondary Geography 
Of the other arable plants, coconut, palm tree, pineapples and tobacco are worth 
mentioning. The farming of coconut has steadily increased in the sandy areas of the 
coast. The farming of African palm trees producing edible oil has a strong economic 
possibility. Comparatively the pineapples are cultivated in the low quality land. 
Rubber and tobacco are produced as arable crop in Sabah and Sarawak. Besides, sago 
and black pepper are also produced in this part of the country. 
Mineral resources : Mineral tin is the principal mineral product of Malaysia. Vast 
quantities of tin ore to produce tin are available. Most of the tin ore available in 
Malaya are procured from alluvial stratum. The high quality ore is deposited in the 
valleys of west coast. The procured mineral tin ore sent to Penang for refinement. The 
ore is very important for producing tin sheets. 
Fig. 65 : Mineral resources of Malaysia 
Coal is procured from the ancient lake basins of Malaya Peninsula. This coal is used 
in the railway engine and other self propelled vehicles. The petroleum fields in the 
hilly slopes of Sabah have earned considerable importance. The important oil fields 
are located in the anticlines of the folds in the hilly slopes of Sarawak. Moreover, 
mineral iron and gold are mined in Malaysia. 
Industry : Tin refineries and petroleum production are the chief industries in 
Malaysia. This country has occupied first place in tin production in the world. 
Malaysia is famous for small and cottage industries. It is one of the countries in Asia 
that produces computer parts and electronic goods.

Transport and communication : Land communications are well developed in the 
country. Railway and roads have reached all the places. Metalled road is about 25,446 
kilometres and railway is about 1,488 kilometres. Railway lines and roads have 
connected the rubber plantations, tin, petroleum, coal, gold, mineral iron producing 
fields, refineries, towns, cities, ports and commercial centres. The railway lines of this 
country are connected with that of Thailand. The sea routes connect the two seperated 
parts of the country.

Foreign Trade : The most important exportable items of Malaysia are rubber, tin and 
palm oil. She also exports tobacco, sago, different spices, coconut kernel and oil, 
coffee and products of cottage industries. Recently Malaysia has earned the fame for 
becoming one of the most industrially advanced countries of Asia by exporting 
equipments, computer parts, electronic goods and other industrial products. Rice is the 
main imported commodity. Cloth and ready-made garments, paper and medicine are 
also imported. Most of the rubber is exported to the United States of America. 
Cities, ports and commercial centres : Kuala Lampur is the capital of Malaysia. 
Georgetown is the main city of Penang and Penang is one of the main sea ports. 
Malacca founded in 1511 is now an old city and has less importance, Sutenham, near 
Kuala Lampur is an important port. Clang is the biggest sea port. Epoh is a tin 
producing centre and a main city. Jacelton is the principal city of the west coast of 
Sabah. Miri, city of Sarawak is the main centre of oil fields. Kuching and Sibu are the 
important river ports.

Population and Development Trends 
Population : High fertility, less mortality and migration are the factors of population 
growth. This country records 2.24% for the rate of population growth, 27.95% for 
birth rate, 5.56% for death rate, and 24.70% for child mortality. Family planning is 
practised to stabilize population growth. Various steps are taken for population control 
so that birth rate is reduced and family size is kept small. These are necessary to 
achieve planned human resource development. 59% are Malaya and other native 
people, 32% are Chinese and 9% are of Indian origin. 78% of the population are 
literate of which 86% are males and 70% are females. All above the age of 10 years 
can read and write. 
Development trend : The country has been gradually moving ahead since its 
independence on 31st August, 1957 from British rule. The development in agriculture 
is remarkable. The government is particularly active in maintaining the trend of 
growth in industries, especially small and cottage industries. People actively 
participate in development programmes. According to world population data sheet 
2010, the Annual Gross National Income (GNI) of this country was 13,740 US Dollar. 
Due to the limited availability of labour force, manpower is imported from friendly 
countries for employment in agriculture, industries and trade and business. Many 
people from Bnagladesh are in employment in Malaysia. 
Malaysia 
What we learnt from this chapter : 
Location and area : Malaysia is an important country of South-East Asia. The South 
China, is in its north, the Celebis Sea in the east, Java Sea in the south and the 
Malacca Strait in the west. The area of the country is 3,29,750 square kilometres and 
population records only 2.89 crore. The density of population is 79 persons per square 
kilometres. 
Physiography : The coastal area of Malaysia is plain land and the central region is 
formed of plateaus. The main water-shed is located near the west coast. The mountain 
ranges extend from north to south. There are coastal plains, hilly slopes and hilly 
regions in Sabah and Sarawak. The rivers are not long. 
Climate : Malaysia experiences rain throughout the year. The strong wind blows over 
the sea from November to March. Since the Sumatra Island remains as a barrier to the 
flow of South-West Monsoon, rainfall is scarce from May to September in the west of 
Malay Peninsula. The North-East Monsoon that blows from October to April, causes 
heavy rainfall in Sabah and Sarawak. Average temperature varies from 25° to 27° 
Celsius throughout the country.
Malaysia	 117 
Natural vegetation : Malaysia is a country of dense and evergreen forest. There is a 
huge aquatic mangrove forest in the plains of west coast and a narrow ring of ÔCassiua 
BinaÕ, a tree of Tarmarisk group in the sandy shore of east coast of Malay Peninsula. 
Valuable hard wood trees like Iron wood, Rose wood, Ebony, Mahogany and Rubber 
as well as palm tree, bamboo and cane are grown in abundance in the equatorial forest 
of central region. 
Agriculture : The agriculture system can be divided into (1) Indigeneous system and 
(2) Arable agriculture system. Rice is produced in the valleys of west coast and the 
east coast of Peninsula. Besides, the farmes grow tobacco, camphor, sago, spices, 
coffee, cocoa, tea and tapioca. The farming of rubber has been practised here as an 
arable system of agriculture. Coconut, palm, pineapple and tobacco are also grown. 
Rubber and tobacco are produced as arable crop in Sabah and Sarawak. Sago and 
black pepper are grown in this part. 
Mineral resources : Mineral tin is the principal mineral product. Petroleum is also 
extracted in the hilly slopes of Sabah. The oil fields are located in the ring of the hilly 
slope of Sarawak. Gold and mineral iron ore are also mined in Malaysia. 
Industry : Tin refineries and petroleum productions are the two principal industries. 
Malaysia is also famous for small and cottage industries. It is one of the countries of 
Asia that produces computer parts and electronic goods. 
Foreign Trade : Rubber, tin and palm oil are the important exportable items. Besides, 
tobacco, sago, spices, coconut kernel and oil, coffee, machineries, computer parts and 
electronic goods are also exported. Moreover, different types of cottage industry 
products are other exported goods. Of the imported commodities rice, cloth, readymade 
garments, paper and medicine are the important ones. 
Population and development trends : The factors of population growth are high 
fertility, less mortality and migration. Population growth in Malaysia is stabilized 
through the adaptation of family planning methods. Moreover, in order to achieve 
planned human resource development, family size is kept small and the birth rate is 
also kept low by practising various methods of birth control. The country has been 
gradually moving ahead since its independence on 31st August, 1957 from British 
rule. The record of development in Malaysia is particularly remarkable in agriculture. 
But the government is also keen to keep up the development trend in small and 
cottage industries.

Chapter Four 
South Korea 
Introduction : Korean Peninsula is a country of East Asia. At the beginning of the 
20th century, Japan had captured this country. As a result, this country became a 
colony of Japan. After the world war is over, Korea became independent in 1945 and 
this country was divided into two parts in 1948 along 30° North latitude and the 
zigzag cease-fire line between South Korea and North Korea was demarcated as 
border line (Fig. 67). At present, South Korea calls Japan Sea as East Sea. 
Location : South Korea is located between 
32°20¢ to 38°00¢ North latitude and 
124°00¢ to 132°00¢ East longitude. The 
island named Tetha-Dongo and Tek Shima 
which are situated far from the main land 
are also included in this state. North 
Korea is situated in the north of this 
country, Japan Sea in the east, Korea 
Strait in the south and the Yellow Sea 
in the west. 193 kilometres wide 
Korea Strait connecting Japan Sea and 
Yellow Sea is situated between Japan 
and South Korea. 
Area and Population : Total area of 
South Korea is about 1,00,032 square 
kilometres occupying about 45 per cent 
of the total land of Korean Peninsula. 
About 4 crore and 89 lakh people live in 
this country and the density of 
population is about 489 persons per 
square kilometre. The people are of 
Mongoloid group. 
Physiography : The country is divided into three regions viz. : (1) The Mountainous 
Region, (2) The Plains Region, and (3) The East Coastal Region. The country covers 
about two-thirds of the mountainous region. Taebaek Hill Tracks of east coast extends 
from north to south. Gaema plateau is joined with Taebaek mountain in the south. 
Many places of hilly region are eroded by the waves of Japan Sea. Though the eastern 
slope of the mountain nearer to Japan Sea is steep but the western and the southern 
slopes are to some extent moderate which gives birth to the plain land and also created 
innumerable islands and canyons. The land slopes mainly towards west and south 
which is evident from the normal flow of the rivers. The plain lands of coastal areas 
between Japan Sea and Taebaek mountain are very narrow and gradully widens 
towards south (Fig. 68).

1. The Mountainous Region : The 
mauntainous region is consisted of 
some scattered peaks, plateaus and the 
valleys. The soil of this region is 
formed of hard granite rock. The height 
of the main peaks of the mountainous 
region is more than 2,400 metres. The 
Gaema plateau joins the Taebaek 
mountain in the south. The broad, low 
and long plain seperating the plateau in 
the south-west has connected the south 
plains with west plains as a link road. 
2. The Plains Region : This area is 
formed of sand and rock. The coastal 
beach formed of sand is used 
specially for bathing. Most of the 
places of this region have been 
eroded by heavy rainfall. 
3. The East Coastal Region : The 
east coastal region is situated between 
east coastal line and Taebaek mountain. 
The east coastal plain land is very 
narrow. This region is not very wide 
and gradully widens towards the south. 
Rivers : There are many rivers in South 
Korea in comparison to the plain land. These 
rivers had great impact on the life style of 
the inhabitants and on the national industrial 
development of South Korea. The main 
rivers of South Korea are Nakdong (521.5 
kilometres) and Han (481.7 kilometres). The 
Han river flowing through the modern Seoul 
city helps to centralise the population and to 
increase the density of population in the 
central region. The rivers flowing into the 
Yellow Sea are comparatively longer and 
have widened gradually nearer to the outlet. 
The rivers remain navigable for a long 
distance, particularly during the high tide 
reaching to the height of about 10 metres.

(12) Seomjin, (13) Nakdong, (14) Geumho, (15) Hwang and (16) Han river have 
fallen into the Korean Strait in the South (Fig. 69). 
The rivers falling into the Japan Sea are narrow and short, and the strong current helps 
to generate hydro-electricity. 
As the three sides of this country are surrounded by sea, the huge quantity of water 
has brought diversity in the life of Korean people and it has impact on the 
development on the navigation and shipbuilding industries of the country. 
Climate : South Korea being located in the temperate zone enjoys fully four seasons 
viz. Summer, Autumn, Winter and Spring. The warm and moist climate is felt during 
the Monsoon summer season from June to September (Fig. 70). This season is very 
comfortable as most of the times, the sky remains clear and the temperature remains 
moderate. The climate remains stagnant in Autumn (October). The winter (November 
to March) becomes cold and dry under the influence of Siberian high pressure. The ice 
flows from north-east to south-west with cold wave blowing along the side of the East 
coast (Fig. 71). As a result, snowfall occours in Northern part and severe cold is felt all 
over the country. Certainly, the South-east coast of the country remains warm due to 
the influence of the warm west current. Spring (April-May) remains dry and warm due 
to the influence of the high pressure. The seasons of low temperature and small rainfall 
is found to occur due to high temperature and heavy rainfall experienced after the 
warm and cold weather felt sequentially in four seasons. 

Due to the evaporation of moisture from the soil, a slight changed continental polar airmass while 
crossing the Gobe desert of China-Mongolia border, carry fine yellow coloured loess soil 
from the loess plateau of China and after crossing the Yellow Sea reaches South Korea. Due 
to the violent flow of this yellow desert storm, dust particles create abnormal situation. 
During the winter months, there is predominance of dust cloud in Korea for which visibility 
becomes poor. The tropical cyclone named as Typhoons occuring during summer season from 
July-August causes heavy loss of crops, households, lives and property. These storms are seen 
frequently at the fag end of this summer. Heavy rainfall occurs during this time and the wind 
blows 242.35 kilometres per hour. Typhoons gradually moves away from the continent due to 
the influence of Siberian high pressure in the month of October (Fig. 72).

South Korea	 123 
The variation of seasonal temperature is 
felt though the temperature of South Korea 
remains between 10° to 16° Celsius. The 
average temperature of the country lies 
between 23° and 26° Celsius in August and 
the temperature comes down to minus 6° 
and 7° Celsius in the coldest month of 
Januray. 
Snowfall and rainfall is recorded between 
1,000 to 1,800 millimetres in South Korea 
(100 to 180 centimetres). The central 
region of the country experiences rainfall 
between 1,100 to 1,400 millimetres (100 to 
140 centimetres) which accounts for about 
50 to 60 per cent of the annual rainfall of 
summer months. 
Natural Vegetation : The predominane of 
natural vegetation is found in the forest of the 
mountainous regions of South Korea. The 
forest has a mixture of both coniferous and 
deciduous trees. The southern plain regions 
are mostly covered by rainfed forests. In summer the trees are decorated 
with deep green, thick and large leaves but the leaves are dropped off during winter. 
Red pines of straight and hard trunk are also besides, Elm, Maple, Linven, Birch, and 
Ash trees, found in these forests. 
Agriculture : The slope of the most parts of the mountainous region is steep, covered 
with thin-soil layer with infertile soil and forest cover. It is difficult to grow rice or even 
vegetables under this condition. 19.8 per cent of total land is under agriculture. 
Extensive farming is practised in 8 per cent of the coastal plains and in the valleys. 7.2 
per cent people are farmers. The farmers remain busy during summer because of heavy 
Moonsoon rainfall. Cultivation is practised by means of irrigation during the dry season, 
particularly in winter. The rice growing land is much more wider in the southern and 
western parts of the country and Vegetables are cultivated by the side of the hilly areas. 
Vegetables are grown than rice more in east coastal plain land. Rice is used to cultivate 
in half of the total agricultural land. Fishing is the second important occupation. 
Rainfall is least in the month of April but this little rainfall is vital for rice cultivation. 
With the first shower, the lands are ploughed and seeds are sown. The rice plants grow 
fast with the rains. The rice growing lands are much more in the southern and western 
parts of the country. Rice is the main staple food. Rice is grown in more than half of 
the cultivable lands. The production of rice remains stable due to the invent of new 
varities of rice and its expansion of new innovative means every year of cultivating 
rice. Millet, barley, wheat, soyabean, peas or red beans are also grown. Rice is reaped 
in October and then the land is prepared for growing barley and wheat. These crops 
are harvested in June and July and rice plants are planted in the rainy days. The total 
yield of millet, barley, and wheat together is higher than that of rice.

Mulberry, cotton, tobacco, flax and jinseng are produced specially as cash crops. 
Soyabean farming is abundant in South Korea. Recently, soyabean cultivation is 
decreasing as import of syabean is increasing day by day. The silk industry exits as an 
ancient glorious industry of South Korea but now it is flourishing. The demand of silk 
has increased in the internal market due to the increase of national income since 1970. 
As a result, silk processing industry is developing in the south-east area of the country. 
Cotton is gown abundantly in this country. Jinseng is an important agricultural 
product. The juice obtained from its roots prevents many diseases creating a high 
demand for it in the country and abroad. Jinseng and tobacco cultivation is 
encouraged by the government. 
Stock rearing has developed in South Korea. The cattle of South Korea is of high 
quality. A large number of cattle are exported every year to Japan. 
Natural Regions : South Korea is divided into five natural regions on the basis of 
physical features and characteristics of products. These regions are discussed below : 
1. Mountainous Region : The density of population is very low in this area though 70 
per cent of the total land is mountainous. The region having rugged surface and 
difficult access, is inhabited sparsely by the native aboriginals. The households in 
many cases have developed keeping some distance in between due to the scarcity of 
plain land for the growth of settlement. Though the inhabitants of this region have 
many problems, they do not only supply the forest and underground resources but still 
they do supply the oxygen and also play an important role in keeping the 
environments in balance in controlling the flood and drought. Besides, the charming 
natural scenery of mountainous region is notable as tourism wealth. 
2. East Coastal Strip Region : This narrow coastal region is cut off from the other 
areas of the country. The inhabitants of the villages are primarily inclined to fishing 
pursuit. They catch fish off the coast in small boats using traditional methods. They 
grow rice and millets in the narrow strip of agricultural rings located into hinterland of 
the coastal area. Tides have little influnce in this coast. 
3. South-East Region : This region is formed in the piedmont regions of the 
mountainous slopes surrounded with Naknong basin. Silk culture has expanded 
considerably in this part of the country. This area has an excellent transport and 
communication system. The port of Busan is located in this area. 
4. South-West Region : This part of the country formed by the agricultural basins is 
very important. Two crops are grown annually. Rice is harvested in October and wheat 
or barley before the start of rain in June. Silk culture is also gaining importance. 
5. North-West Region : The Gyeonggi province of Metropolitan area is closely 
connected with the capital of Seoul. This is a very small area of South Korea. A single 
crop is grown in this region because of extreme cold weather. Wheat, millet, and 
soyabean are produced here. This is the mining area of South Korea. 
Minerals : South Korea has comparatively little deposit of mineral resources. The 
coal mines are mainly located in the province of Gangwon. The production of coal is 
highest in this province. A small quantity of limestone, tungsten, silver, zinc, iron ore, 
copper, lead, graphite and coal are available here. Production of coal is higher than 
other minerals. The coal is of anthracite quality.
South Korea	 125 
Industry : South Korea is trying to progress its development through Labor-oriented 
light industry, heavy chemical industry and Technology-based Hybrid industry. The 
availability of coal and iron ore have accelerated the fast growth of industry in South 
Korea. South Korea is developed in the cotton and woollen industries. Local cotton is 
mixed with imported cotton and high quality cotton cloth is manufactured to meet the 
local demand. Extreme cold in winter has created the demand for woollen cloth that 
has helped the expansion of woollen cloth industry. Production of silk manufacturing 
of cloth has grown here as cottage industry. South Korea imports silk as a raw 
materials at a lower price from China, and exports the silk products after meeting the 
local demand through colouring, desiging and weaving of silk. Besides, Petrochemical 
industry, chemical yarn, machine tools, shipbuilding indurtry, 
telecommunication, motor car, iron and steel industry, cement and electronics industry 
have flourished here. 
Transportation and Communication : The complex geo-physical structure of 
mountainous area creates great obstacles in communication system. Inspite of 
constructing many roads, the villages become disconnected from the outer world 
during snowfall in winter. Railways and roadways are the principal means of 
communication. The railways in the south and south-east region is connected with the 
railway system in the west through a wide corridor. According to 2010 census, the 
country has 1,04,983 kilometres of roads and 3,399 kilometres of railways. After 
1960Õs, the Communication system is very much developed while the number of 
roads, national express highways, motor vehicles are increased along with economic 
development of this country. In 1960Õs, the industrial railway has been flourished to 
procure underground resources. In 1970Õs, Bingal Track main railway line was made 
double and triple track. In 1974, underground railway and recently Express railway 
have been commissioned. As a result, distance becomes less between place to place. 
In 2000 A. D., North and South Korea is connected with railway communication 
system. So, the transportation of goods gradully is increasing. The neighbouring 
countries are connected through waterways while the distant countries by sea and air. 
The communication system by air is comparatively more with the neighbouring 
countries. 
Foreign Trade : Inspite of having a large population, South Korea exports the surplus of 
food grains and industrial goods to foreign countries. The trade relation with China and 
Japan is much healthier. It has also trade relationship with Taiwan, Philippines, 
Bangladesh, India, the oil rich countries of the Middle East and the United States of 
America. High quality garments, electronics, computer parts and shipbuilding 
industries have turned South Korea into one of the most prosperous countries of Asia. 
Foreign markets have been opened for export. Rice, soyabean, silk and fish are 
imported. Iron, machineries, paper, medicines and cotton of high quality are the main 
imported items. 
Cities and Ports : Seoul is the capital of South Korea. Busan is the oldest and biggest 
port. These two cities are quite different in prosperity and progress in comparision to 
other cities. Inchon is the second largest port. Daegu, Daejeon, Gwangju and Mokpo are 
other important cities.

Population and Development Trend 
Population : National industrialisation and urbanization has improved a lot in South 
Korea during the decades of 1960 and 1970. Besides, huge population migrated from 
the village to the towns specially in Seoul. As a result, population has increased 
rapidly in metropolitan area. In recent years, many of the inhabitants of Seoul has 
immigrated in the Suburb areas of the city. According to the census of 2009, it is 
found that the countryÕs population accounts for 16.8 per cent in the age group of 
0-14, 72.6 per cent in 15-64 age group and 10.7 per cent in 65+ age group. The rate of 
population growth in South Korea is 0.29 per cent, birth rate 15.63 per cent, death rate 
4.98 per cent, net migration rate 0.9 per cent, infant mortality rate 20.9 per cent and 
the life expectancy is 80.08 years. A number of different tribal people live in this 
country. The Chinese population is about 20,000. All above the age of 10 years, can 
read and write. 95 per cent of the total population is literate. 
Development Trends : South Korea achieved its independence from foreign rule in 
1945. Since then, the country has recorded consistent economic growth. Behind this 
growth, there has been the export oriented planned economic development. According 
to world population data sheet of 2010, the Annual Gross National Income (GNI) of 
this country was 28,120 US Dollars. The economy of the country has been kept 
enliven through stable labour market, strong pressure of inflation and rapid growth of 
savings in banks. According to the census of 2008, about 2 crore 43 lakh and 47 
thousand people used to participate in economic activities which accounts for 61.8 per 
cent of the total population of which 75.9 per cent are indirectly engaged in social,

South Korea 
What we learnt from this chapter : 
Location and area : South Korea is a country of East Asia. North Korea is in its 
north, Japan Sea to the east, Korea Strait to the south and Yellow Sea to the west. The 
strait of Korea has seperated South Korea from Japan. Total area of this country is 
1,00,032 square kilometres and about 4 crore and 89 lakh people live in this country 
with a density of 491 persons per square kilometre. 
Physiography : This country is divided into three parts according to its physical 
structure. (1) The Mountainous Region, (2) The Plains Region, and (3) The East 
Coastal Region. 
Climate : South Korea enjoys the maritime temparate Climate. In summer, wind 
blows from south-east and in winter from north-west. The summer monsoon causes 
rainfall during April to September. But the winter monsoon coming from the mainland 
of Asia being dry does not give any rainfall. The month of March is the time for 
cyclonic storms and the months from July to August for Typhoon. 
Natural vegetation : The forests in South Korea have a mixture of conifereous and 
deciduous trees. The deciduous forests are in the mountainous region and the plains 
have rainfed forests. 
South Korea	 127 
Agriculture : 20.6 per cent of the total land of the country is used for agriculture. 
Rice is the principal crop. Rice is grown in the southern and western parts of the 
country with wet farming system. Mulberry, soyabean, cotton, tobacco, flax and 
jinseng are produced as cash crops. 
Mineral resources : Small amount of limestone, silver, zinc, tungsten, iron ore, 
copper, lead, graphite and coal are mined in the country. Anthracite coal is available 
here. 
Industry : Though the coal and the iron ore exist in South Korea but still a 
mentionable quantity of raw meterials are imported. The industries are flourishing 
rapidly in this country. Cotton and woollen cloth manufacturing are the principal 
industries. Silk cloth production is treated as cottage industry. Chemical yarn, petrochemical, 
machinery, cement, shipbuilding industries, electronic industries have 
developed fast. 
Transport and communication : Railways and roadways are extensively used for 
transportation and communication. The communication system in the south is 
comparatively more developed. Trade and communication with foreign countries are 
also maintained by sea and air. 
Foreign trade : Rice, Soyabean oil, silk, fish, high quality garments, electronics, 
computer mechineries are exported and the iron and steel machineries, paper, 
medicine, high quality cotton, motor car, ships, semi-conductor and mobile phones are 
imported. 
Population and development trend : According to 2009 census, the rate of 
population growth in South Korea is 0.29 per cent, the birth rate 15.63 per cent, death 
rate 4.98 per cent, net migration rate 0.9 per cent, infant mortality rate 20.9 per cent 
and life expectancy is 80.08 years. The country achieved independence from foreign 
rule in 1945 and attained continuous economic development. According to world 
population data sheet of 2010, the Annual Gross National Income (GNI) of this 
country is 28,120 US Dollars. The economy of South Korea has been kept enliven 
through stable labour market, strong pressure of inflation and rapid growth of savings 
in the banks. Nearly 2 crore people belong to the labour force of the country.

Chapter Five 
The Middle East 
Introduction : Afghanistan, Iran, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, 
Oman, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Turkey, Cyprus 
and Egypt are combinedly known as the Middle East. 
Location : The Caspian Sea and the Black Sea are situated on the north of the Middle 
East, Aegean Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, Libya, and the Red Sea on the west, Sudan, 
Arab Sea, and the Gulf of Persia on the south, and Pakistan on the east. The whole of 
the Middle East is located between 13° North latitude to 42° North latitude and 25° 
East longitude to 74° East longitude and 50° East longitude has crossed through the 
middle of the Middle East. 
Area and Population : Total area of the Middle East is 78,42,364 square kilometres. 
The region is 4,505 kilometres long from east to west while from north to south it is 
3,379 kilometres. There are 18 states of which all except Israel are Muslim states. 
Israel is Jewish state. In respect of area, Saudi Arabia ranks first, Iran second, Egypt 
third, Turkey fourth and Afghanistan fifth. At resent, the total population of this region 
is 40.31 crore and the density of population is 51 persons per square kilometres, but 
the density of population is much higher in the Nile, Euphrates and Tigris. In respect 
of population, Egypt ranks first, Iran second, Turkey third, Iraq fourth, and Saudi 
Arabia fifth. Again in respect of density of population Bahrain is placed first, 
Palestine second, Lebanon third, Israel fourth and Kuwait fifth. 
Area, population, density of population of the different countries with their capitals 
have been presented in Table 5. 
People, Religion and Language : Majority of the people are Caucasian, people of 
diverse faith that includes Islam, Christianity, Judaism and Druz live here, but 96 per 
cent of them are Muslims having two sects namely Sunni and Shia. The people speak 
Persian and Postu according to their places of origin. However English speaking 
people are few in number. 
Physiography : The Middle East is divided into three divisions according to its 
physical features. (1) Mountainous region, (2) Plateau and highlands, and (3) Plains. 
1. Mountainous Region : The Hindu Kush mountain extending to the west from the 
Pamir Plateau is located in the north of Afghanistan. The mountains Elburz and 
Zagros proceeding towards west have met the Armenian Knot. The two mountains 
Pontic and Taurus coming out from the Armenian Knot to the west, are situated in the 
north and south of Turkey respectively.

2. Plateau and Highlands : The Iran Plateau located between Hindu Kush and Elburz 
in the north and Zagros in the south have actually occupied most of the areas of 
Baluchistan, Afghanistan and Iran. The height of the plateau ranges from 902 metres 
to 1,504 metres with average height of 1,200 metres and its central part is relatively 
low. 
The Anatolian plateau stands between Pontic and Taurus mountain. Its average height 
is 750 metres. The plateau slopes down to the west. 
Arabian plateau is formed nearly of the entire Arab and Senai Peninsula. The western 
part is quite high and slopes gradually to the direction of the Persian Gulf in the east 
to meet the plain. In the east there are some highlands to the east of the river Nile of 
Egypt. 
3. Plains : The river basin of the Nile of Egypt and Mesopotamia between the river 
Euphrates and the Tigris is the principal plain region of the Middle East. These two 
plains washed by rivers are very fertile because of alluvial soil. There are plains of 
North Iran near the Caspian Sea, plains of South Iran in the east of Persian Gulf, and 
the Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait plains in the west of Persian 
Gulf, the narrow plains of the Arabian Peninsula by the Red Sea and the small plains 
in the north of Afghanistan by the south of Amudariya. The Nile basin is the principal 
plain of Egypt. 
Climate : It rains in winter in the narrow west coast of the Middle East. In other 
places, the rainfall is very little. The wide difference between the winter and summer 
temperature and extreme weather is the main characteristic of this region. The small 
amount of rain mostly fall as frost in Afghanistan. The cold is extreme in the plateau 
of Iran and there is frost at night. In summer, the sky-remains cloudless and the wind 
is dry and as such extreme heat is felt. The cyclonic wind from the Mediterranean Sea 
causes rainfall in winter in Iraq but scorching heat is the general characteristic of 
summer. The Mediterranean coast of Turkey is the warmest. The valleys in the coast 
of the Aegean Sea has cool summer and cooler winter season. In the Syrian coast it 
rains in winter but the interior is without rain and remains dry. Southern part of Syria 
is becoming desert. Jordan experiences no rain in summer and gets rain in winter. The 
Mediterranean climate is felt in Lebanon, Palestine and Israel. Saudi Arabia is also 
without rain, dry and arid.

134	 Secondary Geography 
Climatic Regions : Distance from the sea, the continental location and the influence of 
local land formation have created three climatic regions in the Middle East. 
1. Hot Desert Climatic Region : The Arabian Peninsula and Egypt are included in this 
climate. The difference between winter and summer is extremely felt in South Syria, 
South Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. 
The air remains always dry and without aqueous vapour. Cyclonic winds rarely 
produce rain. 
Fig. 74 : Climatic region of the Middle East 
2. Cold Desert Climatic Region : This region includes Iran and Afghanistan. Aqueous 
vapour has no access because the place is surrounded by the mountain walls. So there 
is no rain but the place is very cool because of height. The difference of temperature 
between summer and winter is very wide and so the climate here is extreme. 
3. Mediterranean Climatic Region : Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, Sinai 
Peninsula, Cyprus and part of Egypt are included in this climatic region. The westerly 
wind causes rain in winter but the dry trade wind coming from land cannot bring rain in 
summer. Since not a single part of the region is far from the sea, the climate is not extreme. 
Agricultural System : Since plain land is scarce, agriculture has not flourished much 
in all the countries of the Middle East. Agriculture has actually developed in the river 
valleys and deltas. Most of the places of the Middle East have dry agriculture system. 
Irrigation farming is practised in the river valleys. Crop rotation system of agriculture 
is followed in Iran.

Wheat is the main staple food of the people of this region. Wheat is grown in every 
country. Barley, maize, rice, millet, beet, cotton, tobacco, dates, silk, and different 
kinds of citric fruits are other agricultural products depending on places. Stock 
farming is also found in suitable areas. 
Agricultural land in Afghanistan records one-fifth of its total land holding. The 
northern plains and river valleys in that country are widely used for farming. 
Sometimes irrigation is needed. Wheat, barley, rice, maize, beet, cotton and tobacco 
are the leading agricultural products and fruits as grapes, pomegranate, pear and 
walnut are also grown. Stock farming is also practised for wool and meat. 
IranÕs agricultural land accounts for only 10 per cent of the total land. Excepting the 
coast of the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf, crops are grown elsewhere by 
irrigation. Wheat, rice, maize, fruits, cotton, tobacco, opium, grapes and tea are the 
principal agricultural products. In the dry grassland, sheep and goats are tended. 
Fishing has developed considerably. Iraq is chiefly an agricultural country but only 
one, sixth of the land is used for agriculture. Inspite of its soil being alluvial, the 
production is not very high. In the southern part barley, rice and date while in the 
northen part barley, wheat and juicy fruits are produced. Among the cash crops, cotton 
is placed next to date. Fine quality Egyptian cotton is grown in the area between the 
Euphrates and Tigris river. Kurdistan produces lot of tobacco. Mulberry plants are 
grown for silk worm in the district of Baghdad.

In Turkey farming is done only in 30 per cent of its total land area though agriculture 
is the chief means of livelihood of its inhabitants. In the plateau region the principal 
product is the wool and skins of the goats known as Mohair. Wheat and crops are also 
grown in favourable environment. Tobacco, olive, silk, fig, grape, nut and other dry 
fruits and cotton are produced in the coastal areas. 
Syria is also mainly an agricultural country. Crops are grown in the Euphrates valley 
with the help of irrigation. Tobacco is grown in the coast but cotton is produced in 
North Syria. Camel, horse, sheep, goat and thick tailed sheep are raised in the 
grassland areas. Dates are grown in abundance in the oasis. 
The valleys are developed into intensive farming areas of Lebanon. Wheat, barley, 
tobacco, grape, olive and orange are grown. Farming is also practised extensively in 
the plains near west coast and Beka valley. Tobacco is grown extensively in 
abundance in the coast. 
Agriculture has not developed much in Jordan. Wheat, barley, maize, turnip, oat, 
grape and olive are the principal agricultural products. Farming has developed in the 
plains of Israeli coast. Wheat, barley, millet, potato, olive, orange, fig and grapes are 
grown in the fertile lands of Palestine. Scarcity of water has, however created some 
obstacles in the agricultural practices. Wheat and barley are grown in winter and 
maize and turnip in summer in the plain lands. Intensive farming of fruit has 
developed in the northern part. Fruits are grown in plenty in this country. 
In Saudi Arabia, crops are grown in highlands and oasis. Dates, wheat, barley, maize 
and millet are the main products. Coffee is grown in favourable condition. 
Natural Vegetation : No vegetation excepting grass and thorny shrubs are grown in 
the hot and cold desert areas extending from the Arab desert to the border of 
Afghanistan. In the Mediterranean climatic region comparatively smaller trees grow. 
But there is no grassland because the summer is totally without rain. Temperate mixed 
tall plants grow in the north of Turkey and Iran. In the dry plateaus of Iran, thorny 
bushes are the only vegetation. Gum Arabia is collected from these thorny bushes. 
Valuable trunk wood are collected from the forest in the slopes of Elburz mountain. 
Deciduous trees grow in the coastal plains and Elburz mountain. Turkey has a number 
of forests in the north, north-west and south. Fine quality oak, beech, far, elm, lime 
and pine are available in the deep forest of the east of Pontic mountain. Soft and hard 
wood are collected from the plains in the south. 
Mineral Resources : The Middle East has a very rich deposit of mineral substances 
in different countries. But due to underdeveloped communication system and lack 
of proper technological knowledge, these valuable minerals could not be tapped. 
Although in Afghanistan there are deposits of copper and iron ore, lead, silver, 
sulphur and salt in plenty but they are not mined. Iron ore is deposited in Kurdistan, 
copper ore in Hindu Kush, and lead ore in Hazara. Iran is rich in mineral deposits 
but there is not much progress in mining excepting petroleum oil. Majority of the oil 
fields of this country are located in the south-western part. Masjid-e-Sulaiman,
The Middle East	 137 
Haftkhel, Pachshara, Agazari, Naft-e-Safid and Lali are the famous oil fields. The 
largest oil refinery of the world is in Abadan of Iran. 
Oil is pumped through pipes to Abadan from different oil fields. Coal and iron ore are 
mined in north-west Iran. Lead, manganese, copper, nickel, borax, chromite, zinc, 
sulphur, salt, rock and marble stones are available in Iran. Petroleum is the principal 
mineral product of Iraq. Kirkuk, Khanakil, Hadita, Habburnia, Bosra, Khurram Shah 
and Mosul are the reputed oil fields. Petroleum is taken to Haifa of Israel and Tripoli 
of Lebanon through 1,850 kilometres long pipe from Kirkuk and exported abroad. 
Naft Kharech is an important oil field in South Iraq. Kifri produces lignite. This 
country also produces a little quantity of mineral salt and gypsum. Turkey is also rich 
in mineral substances. Coal, iron ore, copper, petroleum, chrome ore, manganese, 
lead, zinc, antimoni, mercury and sulphur are the major mineral products. Lebanon 
produces a little quantity of lignite, asphalt and bitumen. Potash, mineral salt and 
phosphate rock are mined in Jordan. Israel has limited production of the mineral 
substances such as manganese, gold, copper, chromium, lead and magnesium, 
sulphur, limestone and gypsum are also available. This country also produces potash, 
Fig. 76 : Minerals and industrial area of the Middle East 
bromite and petroleum. Petroleum is the major mineral product of Saudi Arabia. 
Shower, Ab Quaik, Damman, Hufuf, Saphania, Bahrain, Katik and Khurmania are the 
principal oil fields.

Industry : Recently there has been considerable development of industry in the 
Middle East. Iran has developed production of modern machineries. Among many 
industries cement, sugar, cotton, silk, wool weaving and turpentine production are 
famous. Cigarette, soap, glass, fruit, and leather preservation industries have also 
flourished in this country. Tabriz, Ispahan, Tehran, Shahbad, Kerman and Samused are 
the principal industrial towns. 
Iraq has not developed much in machinery producing industry. The weaving industry, 
cement, soap, cigarette, vegetable, oil industries are worth mentioning. Of the 
weaving industries blanket, carpet, wool, cotton, and silk cloth are famous. At present, 
Iraq has set up chemical industries, sugar industries and oil refineries. 90 per cent of 
the industries are located in Baghdad while Mosul, Kirkuk and Bosra are other 
industrial cities. 
Turkey has developed sugar, cotton weaving, wool weaving, glass, fig preservation, 
milk products and rose elixir processing industries. Lebanon has also developed 
cotton, silk and rayon industries. The metal work has become a cottage industry in 
Beirut and Tripoli. Food processing industry is another important addition. Salt 
refineries, oil refineries, tannery industries have grown up in Jordan besides food and 
fruit processing plants and cotton weaving industry. 
Israel has cotton and woollen weaving industries in Haifa and Tel Aviv. There are 
many small industrial plants and cottage industries in the Jewish settlement area. 
Small weaving plants have been set up in Majdal in Arab settlement. The small lace 
industry in Nazareth has earned good reputation. The diamond industry has grown up 
in Nathania and Tel Aviv. Motor cars factory and household utensils assembly plants 
have developed with the help of imported parts. The industries in Israel are glass, 
paper, fertilizer, chemicals, rubber and plastic industries. Palestine is famous for small 
and cottage industries. There are many cottage industries in the highlands of Judaea. 
The small weaving industries of Gaza are well known. 
Transport and Communication : Since ancient times, the camels, horses and mules 
were used as beasts of burden to transport goods in the Middle East. Band of 
merchants ran between the capital and the ports in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran. 
Now the communication system has developed as bus and trucks ply in wide metalled 
roads and highways. Roads are the only means of communication in Afghanistan. 
There are about 6,700 kilometres of road. Airways are used to travel to the 
neighbouring countries. 
Iran has 2,600 kilometres long railway but roads have greater importance for 
transportation and the motorways are as long as 24,200 kilometres. Motorways and 
roads play comparatively more effective roles in internal trade. Teheran, Tabriz, 
Meshed and Ispahan are the main airports and one can go abroad by air.
The Middle East	 139 
The two rivers Tigris and Euphrates are lifeline of communication system of Iraq. 
Tigris is navigable round the year. The riverways have contributed considerably 
towards the development of trade and commerce in this country. The railways are 
extended northward from Bosra. Some of the railways are partly metre gauge. The 
railway stretching from Baghdad to Bosra is of standard gauge. 
Turkey depends mainly on railway communication though it has 74,000 kilometres of 
roads. The trade and industry centres are connected by roads and railways. Airlines 
maintain communication between Ankara and Istambul. Roads, railways and airways 
have developed in Syria considerably. Goods are transported by caravans of camels in 
the desert areas. 
Lebanon has got roads, railways and airways. Roads and railways are developed in both 
the plains and mountainous regions. Standard gauge of railway lines are used in the 
plains while the mountainous regions have metre gauge lines. Beirut is the main airport. 
Jordan has got roads, railways and airways. Camels are extremely used in the 
plateaus. Roads have passed through the settlement areas. The western part of the 
country has a long railway line having a number of branches. Amman is a principal 
airport. 
The roads in the plains of Israel are straight and wide having been 3,500 kilometres 
long. The railway lines in Israel are of standard gauge. 
Palestine : An agreement was signed in 1994 
in the United States of America between Izac 
Rabin, Prime Minister, Israel and Yasir 
Arafat, President, PLO on the understanding 
that self administered Palestine is formed of 
Samara and Jerico of Israel, the two occupied 
small cities located on the west coast of 
Jordan rivers and Gaza strip. The area of 
Palestine during that time was 2,410 square 
kilometres and the total population was only 
17.31 lakh. At present, the total area is 6,220 
square kilometres and the total population is 
0.40 crore. Palestine has to depend either on 
roads or caravan of camels. 
The principal cities of Saudi Arabia are linked 
by improved road communication. One can 
go from Jeddah to Mecca and Medina by 
motor car. Motorways have connected Nazaf 
near Baghdad with Medina while railway has 
connected Dahrain, a port in Persian Gulf, with Riyadh capital of Saudi Arabia.

JORDAN 
EGYPT 
(Sinai)
140	 Secondary Geography 
Majority of the habitations in Egypt have been developed in the Nile valley and so, the 
river Nile has become the leading means of communication. The Suez Canal of Egypt 
is very significant in respect of international trade. The main railway line runs from 
Alexandria to Aswan via Cairo. Another railway line runs parallel to Suez Canal 
connecting Suez port in the south with port Said in the north. Cairo-Suez railway is 
also important. Egypt has both unmetalled and metalled roads and in the desert has 
camel path. 
Foreign Trade : The hides and skins, cotton, carpet, dates, fruits, gums, wool, marble 
stone, including petroleum are exported from different countries of the Middle East. 
Cotton cloth, tea, sugar, machineries, railway carriage, motor cars, consumer goods, 
spices, medicine, paper etc. are imported. Middle East countries have trade 
relationship with the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, 
Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and other countries. 
Manpower : The countries in the Middle East have considerable limitations in 
technological know ledge and moreover manpower is also limited. This has resulted in 
large number of manpower import. Many engineers, doctors, nurses, technicians, 
skilled and unskilled labour and drivers from Bangladesh are working in different 
countries of the Middle East. The country is being benefitted by the foreign currency 
they sent, particularly in the field of economic development and standard of living. 
The Middle East 
What we learnt from this chapter : 
Location, area and population : The Caspian Sea and the Black Sea are located in 
the north of the Middle East the Aegean Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, the Libya and 
Red Sea in the west, Sudan and Arab Sea in the south and Pakistan in the east. 
Total area of the Middle East is 78,42,364 square kilometres and the density of 
population is 51 per square kilometre. People of Islam, Judaism, Christianity and 
Druz faith live here. 96 per cent of them are Muslims. 
Physiography : According to its physical structures, the Middle East can be divided 
into three divisions viz. (1) Mountainous region, (2) Plateau and highlands and (3) 
Plains. Elburz and Zagros have extended towards north, Pontic and Taurus towards 
west from Armenian Knot. Anatolia and Arabia are the principal plateaus. 
Mesopotamia and the Nile basins are the two remarkable plains. 
Climate : Extreme weather is the salient feature of the Middle East climate. 
Difference between summer and winter season is insignificantly wide and the rainfall 
is quite insignificant excepting the narrow strip of west coast. The climate of the 
Middle East is divided into (a) Hot Desert, (b) Cold Desert, and (c) Mediterranean 
Climatic Regions. 
Agriculture : Since the quantity of plain land is scarce, the agriculture has flourished 
only in the river valleys and deltas. Wheat is the main agricultural crop. Barley, 
The Middle East	 141 
maize, millet, rice, beet, cotton, tobacco, date, silk and different kinds of fruits are 
grown in this region. 
Natural Vegetation : In the hot and cold desert regions, no plant excepting the thorny 
shrubs and grass can grow in the north of Iran and Turkey, temperate mixed tall 
vegetations are found. 
Mineral Resources : Petroleum is the principal mineral product of the Middle East. 
Besides, Copper ore, iron ore, lead, silver, gold, sulphur, mineral salt, manganese, 
nickel, borax, chromite, zinc, marble stone, coal, antimony, mercury, asphalt, potash, 
phosphate, limestone, gypsum are mined in little quantity depending on the nature of 
the places. 
Industry : In the Middle East, cotton and woollen weaving, match, soap, sugar, silk, 
carpet, cigarette, glass and skin preservation industries have been developed in 
varying degree in various countries. The industrial products are consumed to meet the 
local demand. 
Transport and Communication : Roads are the leading means of communication of 
the Middle East. Roads in every country are very developed and fit for motor traffic 
round the year. Railway has not been developed in all the countries. Only in Egypt 
and Iraq, passengers and commodities are transported by rivers in limited area. 
Capitals of every country are connected with foreign countries by air. 
Foreign Trade : Petroleum is the main exportable item of the Middle East. Other 
exportable items are hides and skins, different mineral products, cotton, carpets, dates, 
fruits, gums, wool, marble stone, cotton cloth, tea, sugar, cloth, machineries, railway, 
railway carriages and motor cars, consumer goods, wool, medicine, paper etc. are imported.

Location : Bangladesh is located in South Asia in the southern part of the continent of 
Asia. Bangladesh is an independent sovereign country. This country is situated 
between 20°34¢ North latitude and 26°38¢ North latitude and between 88°01¢ East 
longitude and 92°41¢ East longitude. The Tropic of Cancer passes through the central 
part of Bangladesh. 
Area : The total area of Bangladesh is 1,47,570 square kilomitres. According to 
Bangladesh Statistical Bureau, 1996-97, the area under rivers is 9,405 square 
kilometres and that of the forest is 21,657 square kilometres. The total area of 
Bangladesh excluding rivers and forest is only 1,16,508 square kilometres. A huge 
area is rising slowly due to accretion in the coastal region to the south of Bangladesh. 
It is expected that with such accretion in the south, the total area of Bangladesh would 
increase. 
Boundary : Bangladesh is surrounded by sea on one side and by different states of 
India on other three sides. To the north of Bangladesh, there is West Bengal, 
Meghalaya and Assam, to the east there is Assam and Tripura, Mizoram and also 
Myanmar, and to the south the Bay of Bengal and to the west the state of West 
Bengal. The total length of the boundary of Bangladesh is about 4,711.18 kilometres 
of which about 3,715.18 kilometres is found to exist between Bangladesh and India, 
whereas, the coastal boundary extends for only 716 kilometres (Fig.78). 
Physiography 
The physiography influences agriculture, industry, trade and commerce, transportation 
and communication system. The influence of physiography in the economic 
development is immense. 
Bangladesh is one of the largest deltas of the world. The Padma, the Brahmaputra, the 
Surma and the Kushiyara flowing from the west, north and south-east respectively 
have together formed this huge delta.
144	 Secondary Geography

The plains are ideal for permanent settlement. The whole area of Bangladesh is a great 
plain, but there is little highland in Bangladesh. Bangladesh can be divided into three 
major physiographic divisions :

Fig. 79 : Physiography of Bangladesh 
1. The Hills of the Tertiary Age : This region covers the hills of the south-east and 
north-eastern parts of Bangladesh. These hills were formed along with the formation 
of the Himalayan Mountains, and so, these are called the hills of Tertiary age. It is 
assumed that Lusai hills of Assam and the Arakan of Myanmar are considered to be of 
the same age. These hills are formed of the sandstone, shales and mud. The hills of 
this region are divided into two, such as (a) Hills of the South-East, (b) Hills of the 
North and North-East.

146	 Secondary Geography 
(a) Hills of the South-East : Rangamati, Bandarban, Khagrachhari, CoxÕs Bazar and 
the eastern part of Chittagong cover this region. The average height of these hills is 
610 metres. The peak of Keokradong (1,230 metres) of Bangladesh is located in the 
south-eastern part of this region. Recently, another peak named as Tajiodong (Bijoy) 
of 1,231 metres in height has been discovered in Bandarban. This is now the highest 
peak of Bangladesh. 
(b) Hills of the North and North-East : The heights of the hills in the north of 
Mymensingh and Netrokona districts, in the north-east of Sylhet district and the hills 
of the south of Moulavi Bazar and Habiganj are not more than 244 metres. The hills 
of the north are locally known as Tila. The height of these Tilas varies from 30 to 90 
metres. 
2. The Terraces of Pleistocene Period : The Pleistocene period is over 25,000 years 
old. The Barind of the north-west, the Madhupur and Bhawal Garh of the central part 
and the Lalmai hills or highland of Comilla district cover this region. It is thought that 
these terraces were formed during the Pleistocene period. The description of these 
highlands are given below : 
(a) The Barind : The Barind covers an area of 9,320 square kilometres in the northwestern 
region of the country. The height of this region above the flood plain is about 
6 to 12 metres. The colour of the soil is grey and red. 
(b) The Madhupur and Bhawal Garh : The Madhupur Garh is situated in Tangail 
and Mymensingh districts and the Bhawal Garh is in Gazipur district. The area is 
about 4,103 square kilometres. The height of this region above the plain land is about 
30 metres. The colour of the soil is grey and red. 
(c) Lalmai Hills : The Lalmai Hills stretch from Lalmai, 8 kilometres to the west of 
Comilla town to Maynamati. This region covers an area of 34 square kilometres and 
the average height is 21 metres. 
3. The Recent Flood Plains : Excepting the hills of Tertiary Age and the Pleistocene 
Terraces, the whole of Bangladesh is a plain land drained by rivers. Innumerable small 
and big rivers are found everywhere in Bangladesh. These rivers flow through the 
plain land causing floods during rainy seasons. This flood plain has been formed due 
to the deposition of the sediments brought down by the rivers for years together. The 
total area of this flood plain is 1,24,266 square kilometres.
Bangladesh	 147 
This plain land slopes towards the coast from the north of Bangladesh. The Sunderban 
region stands almost at sea level. The other regions such as Dinajpur stands at a height 
of 37.50 metres, Bogra at 20 metres, Mymensingh at 18 metres, Narayanganj and 
Jessore at 8 metres. Innumerable marshy and lowlands are scattered throughout this 
region. Some of these are abandoned Ox-bow lakes. Locally, these are known as beel, 
jheel or haor. Of these, the Chalan Beel and the haors of Madaripur and Sylhet are 
remarkable. These are submerged during the rainy season and turn into lakes. The 
layer of the soil of the whole flood plain is very deep and very fertile. The recent flood 
plain can be divided into several divisions, viz. 
(a) Piedmont Plain of Rangpur and Dinajpur. 
(b) The Flood Plain of Dhaka, Tangail, Mymensingh, Pabna, Jamalpur, Comilla, 
Noakhali and Sylhet. 
(c) The Deltaic Plain comprising of some parts of Faridpur, Kushtia, Jessore, Khulna 
and Dhaka. 
(d) The Flat Coastal Plain of Chittagong extending from the lower part of Noakhali 
and the Feni rivers to CoxÕs Bazar. 
(e) 		The Tidal Plain or the Mangrove Forest comprising of some parts of Khulna and 
Patuakhali region and Barguna district. 
Rivers 
Bangladesh has got about 700 rivers. Due to the presence of a large number of rivers, 
Bangladesh is called a riverine country. The rivers influence the life style of the 
people of Bangladesh. The Padma, the Brahmaputra, the Jamuna, the Meghna and the 
Karnaphuli are the major rivers of Bangladesh. These rivers have also got their 
tributaries and distributaries. The total length of all the rivers including tributaries and 
distributaries. The total length of all the rivers including tributaries and distributaries 
is about 22,155 kilometres. The description of the rivers of Bangladesh is given below 
(Fig. 80). 
The Padma : The Padma is one of the largest rivers of Bangladesh. This has 
originated from the Gangatri glacier. Then it flows to the south-west and then to the 
south-east taking the name of the Ganges at Haridwar and enters into the plain lands. 
From this point, the Ganges flow through Uttar Pradesh and Bihar State leaving 
distributary named the Bhagirathi (Hooghly) river at Dhulian of Murshidabad district 
in West Bengal. The Bhagirathi falls into the Bay of Bengal. The main flow of the 
148	 Secondary Geography 
Ganges takes the name of Padma at the south-western point at Rajshahi region and 
flowing for about 145 kilometres through West Bengal and along the border of 
Bangladesh enters into Bangladesh through the north-western point of Kushtia 
district. Then it meets the Jamuna river at Daulatdia ghat. This combined stream flows 
towards the south-east as the Padma and meets the Meghna at Chandpur. Afterwards, 
the combined flow of these three rivers fall into the Bay of Bengal as the Meghna. The 
Padma drains an area of 34,188 square kilometres. 
The Kumar, the Mathabhanga, the Bhairab, the Gari, the Madhumati, the Arial khan 
etc. are the distributaries of the Padma river and the Mahananda is the main tributary. 
The Punarbhava, the Nagor, the Pagla, the Kulik and Tangan are the tributaries of the 
Mahananda. 
The Brahmaputra : The Brahmaputra river originates from a glacial part of Kailash 
Peak of the Himalayas, then flows to the east over Tibet and finally passes through 
Assam to the west. Thereafter, the Brahmaputra rivers enters into Bangladesh near 
Kurigram district. Thereafter, this river takes a turn towards south-east near 
Dewanganj and then flowing through the district of Mymensingh falls at the Meghna 
to the south of Bhairab Bazar. The Dharla and the Tista are the main tributaries and 
the Bangshi and the Shitalakhya are the major distributaries of the Brahmaputra river. 
The Jamuna : The main branch of the Brahmaputra near Dewanganj of Mymensingh 
district flows towards south as the Jamuna to meet the Padma river near Daulatdia. 
The Karotoa and the Atrai are the major tributaries of the Jamuna and the Dhaleshwari 
is its distributary. Whereas the Buriganga is the distributary of the Dhaleshwari. 
The Meghna : The Barak river of Assam originates from Naga-Manipur region and 
being divided into two branches as the Surma and the Kushiyara, enter into Sylhet 
district of Bangladesh. The Surma, the northern branch, flows towards west by the 
side of Sylhet, Chhatak and Sunamganj. The Surma of north Sylhet, the Kushiyara of 
South Sylhet, the Kalni of Habiganj meet together near Ajmiriganj. Then the 
combined stream of the Kalni, the Surma and the Kushiyara after flowing some 
distance to the south as the Meghna, joins the old Brahmaputra in the south of Bhairab 
Bazar and flowing to the south-west it meets the Padma near Chandpur and ultimately 
falls into the Bay of Bengal as the Meghna. The Meghna drains an area of about 
29,785 square kilometres. The Monu, the Baulai, the Titas, the Gumti, are the 
tributaries of the Meghna.

The Karnaphuli : Two hundred and seventy four kilometres long the Karnaphuli 
river having originated from the Lusai Hills in Assam and flowing through Rangamati 
and Chittagong region falls into the Bay of Bengal. This is the main river of 
Chittagong and Rangamati. The major tributaries of the Karnaphuli river are the 
Kassalong, Halda, and Boalkhali. A Hydro-electric Project has been constructed at 
Kaptai on the Karnaphuli river. The main sea port of Bangladesh is situated at the 
south of the Karnaphuli river. 
The Sangu : The origin of the Sangu river is in the Arakan Mountain. Originating 
from the boundary of Myanmar and Bangladesh and flowing through Bandarban and 
Chittagong, the river falls at the south of the mouth of Karnaphuli into the Bay of 
Bengal. 
The Feni : The Feni river is situated in the district of Feni. The origin of this river is 
in Tippera Hills. Flowing through the eastern side of Feni, this river falls into the Bay 
of Bengal at the north of Sandwip. 
Climate 
The climate of Bangladesh is more or less moderate. As the Tropic of Cancer passes 
through the centre of the country, the climate prevailing is tropical. The influence of 
the Monsoon wind on the climate of this country is so strong that as a whole, the 
climate of Bangladesh is known as tropical monsoon climate. The characteristics of 
the monsoon climate is the appearance of different seasons in a year. A little variation 
in the climate in different seasons is well marked. But Bangladesh never experiences 
extreme climate like the cold and warm countries. In fact, hot and humid summer and 
dry and comfortable winter are the remarkable characteristics of the climate of 
Bangladesh. 
The average annual temperature is 26.01° Celsius and the average rainfall is about 203 
centimetres. The rain occurs from June to October due to the influence of the 
monsoon in this country (Fig. 81). Maximum rain occurs in Sylhet region in 
Bangladesh.
Bangladesh	 151 
Fig. 81 : Annual average rainfall of Bangladesh 
The climate of Bangladesh, on the basis of Monsoon wind, rainfall, annual 
temperature is divided into three seasons, viz. (a) Summer Season, (b) Rainy Season 
and (c) Winter season. 
(a) Summer Season : The summer season in Bangladesh extends from the month of 
March to May (Falgun to Jaishtha). The temperature gets increasing in this season, as 
the sun gives vertical rays over the tropic of cancer during this period. The 
temperature, wind direction and the rainfall of this season is discussed below : 
Temperature : The summer is the hottest season in Bangladesh. During this season, 
the maximum temperature of 34° Celsius and the lowest of 21° Celsius is recorded. 
152	 Secondary Geography 
The average temperature of 28° Celsius is found to prevail in the month of April. 
During this time, the temperature increases gradually to inland from the coastal region 
of this country (Fig. 82). 
Fig. 82 : Temperature of Bangladesh (July) 
Rainfall : The Kalbaishakhi thunderstorm or the Norwester is one of the important 
characteristics of summer weather. This Kalbaishakhi thunderstorm occurs with high 
intensity during the months of March to April. About 20 per cent of the total annual 
rainfall occurs due to Kalbaishakhi storms. About 20 per cent of the annual rainfall of 
Bangladesh comes in summer. During this time, the average rainfall recorded is about 
51 centimetres. 
BAY OF BENGAL
Bangladesh	 153 
Wind : A change in air pressure is found to occur due to the northward movement of 
the sun in the northern hemisphere. The hot and humid air coming from the south 
rises upward due to high temperature and comes in collision with the cold and dry air 
coming from the north-west causing rainfall with thunderstorms. 
(b) Rainy Season : The rainy season extends from June to October (Jaishtha to 
Kartik) in Bangladesh i.e. the interim period between summer and winter with rain is 
known as the rainy season. During the first half of June, the rainy season starts with 
the advent of Monsoon wind. The characteristics of rainy season is discussed below : 
Temperature : The sun gives vertical rays during rainy season in Bangladesh. As a 
result, the temperature increases. But due to cloud cover and heavy downpour, the 
high temperature is not felt. The average temperature is 27° Celsius. The month of 
April is the hottest month. 
Rainfall : During the rainy season, south-west monsoon wind blowing over 
Bangladesh brings heavy moisture from the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal. This 
moisture causes heavy convectional rainfall. 80 per cent of the total annual rainfall 
occurs during this time. 
Wind : There is a change in air pressure due to the location of the sun over 
Bangladesh in the month of June. The rainy season begins when the south-west trade 
wind starts blowing from the Bay of Bengal. During this time, the north-east trade 
wind subsides and the south-east trade wind after crossing the equator, according to 
FerrelÕs Law, is deflected towards right and it becomes south-west monsoon wind. 
After the rainy season is over, the cyclone hits Bangladesh occasionally. 
(c) Winter Season : The period from the end of November to February (Kartik to 
Falgun) is known as winter. The temperature starts declining after September and 
October. The lowest temperature is found to prevail in January (Fig. 83).
154	 Secondary Geography 
Fig. 83 : Temperature of Bangladesh (January) 
Temperature : The minimum temperature is found in winter is our country. During 
this season, the maximum temperature of 29° Celsius and minimum of 11° Celsius is 
recorded. The coldest month is January and the average temperature recorded is 17.7° 
Celsius. During winter, the temperature decreases towards north from the coast to 
inland. In the history of Bangladesh, the lowest temperature ever recorded was 1° 
Celsius in 1905 in the district of Dinajpur northern region. 
Rainfall : During winter, Bangladesh does not normally experience any rainfall. At 
this time, the north-east cold monsoon wind blows over Bangladesh. A little amount 
of rainfall occurs in the coastal and in the mountainous regions during winter. The 
rainfall accounts for not more than 10 centimetres.

Wind : During winter season, the humidity in the air is less as the cold Monsoon 
wind blows from the north-east over Bangladesh. The lowest humidity recorded 
during this time is 36 per cent. Sometimes, very cold wind blows over the northern 
region and as a result, it experiences very cold weather. 
Forest Resources 
The accumulation of trees is known as forest. The resources which are produced or 
collected from the forest is known as forest resources. Forest resources have a great 
part to play in the economic development of the country. 25 per cent of the total land 
should remain under forest cover for the economic development of a country. During 
1995-96, the area of the forest was 21,914 square kilometres. At present, the area of 
the forest of Bangladesh is 25,000 square kilometres i.e. about 62 lakh acres of land 
remians under forest which accounts for only 17 per cent of the total land. The forest 
cover in Bangladesh is remarkably less compared to the demand. The forest cover is 
diminishing day by day to meet greater demand for timber for housing and furniture 
and wood for fuel caused by the increase of population. The following table shows the 
area of the forest in Bangladesh in comparison to other countries of the world. 
Table 6 : Percentage of the total area of the forest cover in comparison to other 
countries (Bangladesh Forest). 
Source : 1 Bangladesh Economic Survey, 2003, Page 63 
Account of forest resources of Bangladesh : Due to the variation of the soil and 
climate, different types of natural vegetation is found to grow in different regions of 
Bangladesh. According to the characteristics of the vegetation, the forests of 
Bangladesh has been classified as follows. 
1. Tropical Evergreen and Deciduous Forest : The trees which do not shade their 
leaves at a time and the leaves remian more or less evergreen are known as Evergreen 
Deciduous Forest, but trees which shade their leaves at a time are known as 
Deciduous Trees. In Bangladesh too, there are two types of forest. These forests cover 
156	 Secondary Geography 
the major parts of Khagrachhari, Rangamati and Bandarban and a considerable part of 
Chittagong and Sylhet districts of Bangladesh. The area of this forest is 14,102 square 
kilometres. Due to heavy rainfall, evergreen trees have developed in this forest (Fig. 84). 
Fig. 84 : Forest resources of Bangladesh 
Evergreen trees like Chapalish, Moyna, Telsur etc. are found in this forest. Gamari, 
Shimul, Koroi, Teak. Jarul etc. are among the deciduous trees. Besides, bamboo, cane, 
wax, honey and medicinal herbs are collected from this type of forest. 
2. Tropical Deciduous Forest : The trees of the tropical regions which shade their trees 
once a year are known as Tropical Deciduous Forest. The Pleistocene Terraces of 
Bangladesh are covered with this forest. This type of forest is found in Mymensingh, 
Tangail, Gazipur, Rangpur and Dinajpur. This forest has been divided into two parts viz.

(a) The forest cover of Mymensingh, Tangail, and Gazipur districts is known as 
Madhupur Tract and Bhawal Garh, (b) The forest cover found in Dinajpur district is 
known as the forest of Barind region. The Sal trees are perdominant in both the types of 
forests. The trees of Madhupur and Bhawal Garh forest region is locally known as Gajari. 
Moreover, Koroi, Hizal, Bohera, Horitoki, Kathal, Nim etc. trees are found in the 
forest of Madhupur and Bhawal Garh. The total area of this forest is 1,338 square 
kilometres. About 95 per cent of the trees in the forest of Barind region is Sal. The 
area of this forest is only 22 square kilometres. 
3. Mangrove Forest or the Sunderban : The area of this forest is 6,474 square 
kilometres. This forest covers the districts of Khulna, Satkhira, Bagerhat and Barguna. 
This forest occupies 95 square kilometres of the south-west of Barguna and the rest 
covers the southern parts of Satkhira, Khulna and Bagerhat districts. The Sunderi and 
the Garan are the main trees of this forest. Among other trees, Gewa, Passur, Dhundal, 
Keora, Garan, Bayen etc. are remarkable. Golpata is abundantly grown in the 
Sunderban. 
Importance of the forests : Forests play a great role in the economic development of 
a country. The forest resource is limited in Bangladesh, yet its role in the economic 
development of the country cannot be ignored. The forest of Bangladesh contributes 5 
per cent to the national income of the country. The importance of the forest resources 
to the economic development is discussed below : 
1. Collection of consumable goods : To meet their daily needs, people collect wood, 
bamboo, cane, honey, wax etc. from the forest. The skins of animals and the medicinal 
herbs are also collected from the forest. 
2. Construction materials : The people collect wood, bamboo, cane etc. from the 
forest for the construction of houses and for making of furniture. The people collect 
valuable timber from Sal, Teak, Mehogani, Garjan, Gamari and Koroi trees for 
construction purposes and to make furniture. 
3. Agricultural development : The forest of the country keeps the climate humid. As 
a result, there is abundant rainfall which is essential for agriculture. Besides, the 
forests prevent soil depletion and control floods. 
4. Development of industries : The forest resources are used for the production of 
paper, rayon, match, fibre board and the accessories for toys and have thus accelerated 
the development of industries. The Karnaphuli Paper Mill and the Newsprint Mill of 
Khulna have been established on the availability of forest resources.
158	 Secondary Geography 
5. Transportation and communication system : The wood collected from the forest 
is used to make railway slippers, frame for buses, trucks, boats, launches, ships, 
electric poles, bridges etc. 
6. Sources of government revenue : The government can have income from the 
forest resources. For example, the government can increase its revenue by selling or 
disposing of the forest resources and by imposing taxes on such resources. 
7. Foreign currency earnings : Bangladesh is earning huge amount of foreign 
currency by exporting the hides and skins, tooth, horns, feather of different types of 
animals, industrial raw materials and the live animals from the forests. 
Power Resources 
At the root of the modern civilisation, there is power resources. The economic 
development has been accelerated with the progress of civilisation and the invention 
of sources and uses of new energy resources. 
In the beginning, the people would depend on their muscle power. Afterwards, they 
started to use the animal for different works. Indeed, economic development started 
through the use of inanimate energy. The people from the very ancient times they have 
been producing energy by burning wood. Besides, Energy is produced form 
waterflow. The coal, mineral oil and natural gas are considered as the prime sources of 
power. There are hardly any coal and oil resources in this country. There is however, 
significant reserve of natural gas. The country is said to be rich in gas resources. But it 
is not possible to meet the energy demand by gas alone. 
Hydro-electric power is one of the main resources of energy. Hydro-electric power 
accounts for only 6 per cent of the total energy of the world. Bangladesh is a riverine 
country. There is every possibility of producing hydro-electricity in the riverine 
country of Bangladesh. It is possible to produce hydro-electricity by putting dam on 
the hilly rivers. Besides, Bangladesh being abundant in natural gas, thermal plants 
have been established using gas. 
The total electricity production capacity in the country was 2,908 megawatt during 
1996-97. But actually 2,148 megawatt of electricity was produced in the country. The 
energy capacity increased to 4,230 megawatt during 2001-02 and in 2007-08 to 5,262, 
and 2009-10 (March, 10 till), it has increased to 6,033 megawatts. Of the total 
electricity production 88.24 per cent was gas based, 3.18 per cent hydro-electric 
based, 3.81 per cent coal based and 4.77 per cent fuel oil based. During 1991-92, the 
per capita electricity production was only 79 kilowatts hour which increased to 99 
kilowatts hour during 1996-97. On the other hand, 2001-02, per capita electricity 
production was 136 kilowatts hour which increased to 165 kilowatts hour during 
2007-08. At present, the per capita electricity production 220 kilowatts hour (Source : 
Bangladesh Economic Survey, 2010, Page 115,116,118). 
A. Hydro-electricity : In general, the electricity which is produced by harnessing the 
running water is known as Hydro-electricity. Some of the Hydro-electric Projects of 
Bangladesh are discussed below (Fig. 85).
Bangladesh	 159 
1. Karnaphuli Hydro-electric Project : The Karnaphuli river is dammed at Kaptai in 
Rangamati and the water is harnessed to produce electricity. The project was 
constructed in 1962. At present, 120 thousand kilowatts of electricity is produced by

2. Sangu Project : The hydro-electricity is produced by constructing a dam over the 
Sangu river in Bandarban district. 
B. Thermal Power : Thermal electricity is another most important source of power. 
Thermal electricity is more profitable where the production of hydro-electricity is 
either difficult or expensive. Generally, the electricity which is produced by burning 
natural gas, mineral oil, coal etc. is known as thermal electricity. The production cost 
of thermal electricity is more in comparison to hydro-electricity. To meet the countryÕs 
demand of electricity, the production of thermal electricity is more necessary. 
There are some thermal plants to meet the countryÕs demand of electricity. Coal, 
natural gas and mineral oil are used to produce thermal electricity. During 2008-09, 
Bangladesh produced 5,496 megawatt of thermal electricity (Source : Bangladesh 
Statistical Yearbook, 2009/July 2010, Table 6.03). 
Brief description of the main thermal plants of Bangladesh are given below : 
1. Ashuganj Thermal Plant : This thermal plant is located at Ashuganj in 
Brahmanbaria district. The first unit went into production in 1970. The production 
capacity of this unit is 1 lakh 10 thousand kilowatts, Natural gas is used in this plant. 
2. Ghorasal Thermal Plant : This unit is located at Ghorasal in Narsingdi district. 
Natural gas is used for production of electricity. The capacity to produce electricity is 
1 lakh 10 thousand kilowatts. 
3. Siddhirganj Thermal Plant : This unit was established at Siddhirganj of 
Narayanganj district. Natural gas is used for the production of 80 thousand kilowatts 
of electricity. 
4. Shahzibazar Thermal Plant : This unit is situated at Shahzibazar of Sylhet 
district. Natural gas is used in this unit as fuel. The gas is supplied from Habiganj. The 
production capacity is 1 lakh 4 thousand kilowatts. 
5. Chittagong Thermal Plant : The electricity is supplied to Chittagong city and to 
its neighboring areas. Its production capacity is 80 thousand kilowatts. 
6. Goalpara Thermal Plant : This thermal unit was established by the bank of the 
Bhairab river at Goalpara of Khulna district. The production capacity is 80 thousand 
kilowatts. The electricity is supplied to Khulna and its surrounding areas.
Bangladesh	 161 
Bangladesh is not self sufficient in power resources. The electricity produced by 
hydro-electric plants and the electricity generated by thermal units using natural gas 
as fuel is not sufficient in comparison to requirements. At present, Bangladesh is 
producing 4,296 megawatts of electricity. Many countries in the world use atomic 
energy to produce electricity. It has not yet been possible to produce electricity in 
Bangladesh using atomic energy. 
The role of power resources is important for the economic development of any 
country. Electricity, now-a-days, is used in modernising the agricultural system i.e. in 
switching over to mechanised cultivation, in irrigation and in other projects. The use 
of power resources is extensive in industrial and rural development, in transportation 
and communication, in fuel and in trade and commerce. 
Mineral Resources 
Among natural resources, mineral resources are particularly remarkable. But, mineral 
resources in Bangladesh are not abundant. Economic development is hampered due to 
the scarce quantity of mineral resources in Bangladesh in comparison to requirements. 
A detailed discussion on the available mineral resources is given below (Fig. 86). 
1. Coal : Coal is one of the sources of energy. Coal is used to run the machineries, 
factories, railways, steamers etc. Coal is also used as fuel. Bangladesh is not rich in 
coal resources. A low grade peat coal in good quantity is available in Baghia and 
Chanda Beel of Faridpur, Kola Beel of Khulna and in few places of Sylhet. 
Besides, a reserve of high quality coal of bituminous and lignite variety has been 
found in Rajshahi, Bogra, Naogaon and Sylhet district. Recently the production of 
coal has been started at Barapukuria coal field in Dinajpur. 
2. Mineral oil : The experts think that there is mineral oil in the coastal region of 
Bangladesh. Oil was found in the seventh well of Haripur of Sylhet district in 1986. 
Everyday about 600 barrels of crude oil from this well is extracted and sent to 
Chittagong Refinery for processing. Petrol, kerosene, bitumin and other products are 
produced from crude oil. The second oil field of Bangladesh is located at Baramchal of 
Moulavi Bazar district. About 1,200 gallons of oil is extracted everyday from this field. 
3. Limestone : Limestone is available in Jafflong and Zakiganj of Sylhet district, in 
Bhangarghat, Baglibazar, Lalghat and Takerghat of Sunamganj district, in Sitakunda 
of Chittagong district and in St. MartinÕs Island of CozÕs Bazar district. Limestone is 
also available in Jamalganj of Jaipurhat district and in Jaipurhat of Rajshahi Division. 
Limestone is used as a raw material for cement. Besides, limestone is also used in 
glass, bleaching powder, soap and paper industries.
162	 Secondary Geography 
Fig. 86 : Mineral resources of Bangladesh 
4. China clay : White clay is available in Rajshahi, Naogaon and Mymensingh. This 
white clay is used for the production of Chinawares (Crockeries), electric insulators 
and sanitary materials. 
5. Copper : Copper is available in Ranipukur and Pirganj of Rangpur district and in 
Madhyapara of Dinajpur district along with hard rocks. 
LEGEND
Bangladesh	 163 
6. Hard rock : Hard rock is used in the construction of the railways, roads, houses, 
bridges, dams and in flood control projects. This hard rock is available in Ranipukur 
and Shyampur of Rangpur district and Madhyapara of Dinajpur district. Arrangements 
have been made to extract hard rocks in Ranipukur of Rangpur district with foreign 
assistance. The experts think that from this field, about 17 lakh tons of hard rock may 
be extracted. Attempts have been made to extract hard rock from Madhyapara of the 
district of Dinajpur with foreign assistance. 
7. Silica sand : Generally, silica sand is used in glass production. Besides, silica sand 
is also used in producing paints and chemical materials. The sand is available in 
Nayapara, Shahzibazar, Kulaura, Chhatian of Sylhet district. Balizuri in the south of 
Sherpur district and Dohazari of Chittagong district. About 1 lakh 18 thousand cft. of 
silica sand is produced annually in Bangladesh. 
8. Atomic minerals : Generally, atomic minerals are used in heavy metallic 
industries. Huge quantity of mineral sand is found to occur in the area extending from 
Kutubdia of Chittagong district to Teknaf coastal region. Zircon, monazite, ilmenite, 
magnatite, leokcen etc. are the atomic minerals. In collaboration with the Australian 
Government, a pilot scheme is going to be taken up to collect the atomic minerals. 
9. Sulphur : Sulphur is generally used in chemical industries. It is used for producing 
explosives, insecticides, acid, purification of petroleum, match etc. Sulphur is 
available in Kutubdia Island of Chittagong district. 
10. Natural gas : Bangladesh, in comparison to other countries of the world is 
lagging behind in mineral resources. But, Bangladesh is rich in natural gas. Natural 
gas is an important fuel resources which accounts for 75 per cent of the total 
commercial consumption. The total number of gas fields so far discovered upto June, 
2010, was 23. But at present, gas is being tapped from 79 wells of 17 oil fields. 
During 1997-98, actual production was 282 billion cft. and during 1998-99, this 
increased to 308 billion cft., 2001-02 years this was 392 billion cft. and 2006-07 years 
this was 562 billion cft. Presently, total reserve is about 28.85 trillion cft. (Source : 
Bangladesh Economic Survey, 2010, Page 129). 
The gas fields of Bangladesh are Sylhet, Chhatak, Rashidpur, Habiganj, Kailashtila, 
Bakhrabad, Titas, Begumganj, Kutubdia, Kamta, Semutang, Feni, Beanibazar, 
Fenchuganj, Jalalabad, Meghna, Narsingdi, Shahbajpur, Sangu, Saldanadi, Bibiana, 
Moulavi Bazar and Bangura. The uses of gas and its importance is discussed below 
(Fig. 87).
164	 Secondary Geography 
Fig. 87 : Natural gas fields of Bangladesh 
1. Fuel in industries : Natural gas is used as fuel in our industries. The fuel problem 
is thus relieved to some extent. Natural gas is used in commercial installations. At 
present, about 75 per cent of the total fuel in Bangladesh is natural gas. 
2. Electricity production : The importance of natural gas is not insignificant in the 
field of electricity production. Natural gas, instead of furnace oil is used in few of the 
electricity producing centres such as in Siddhirganj, Shahzibazar, Ashuganj and 
Ghorasal. As a result, the production cost for electricity becomes less. Electricity may 
be consumed at a cheaper rate in industries and in the residentail areas. 
3. Industrial raw materials : Natural gas is being used as a raw material in the 
fertilizer factories. Besides, natural gas is also used to produce insecticides, rubber, 
plastic, synthetic fiber etc.
Bangladesh	 165 
4. Employment : Gas exploitation and discovery have created employment 
opportunities for many people. They are engaged in extraction of gas, well digging, 
maintenance and marketing etc. 
Natural gas is thus being used in agriculture, in industries, and in domestic purposes. 
Natural gas is also one of the important sources of revenue. The government earns a 
remarkable portion of its revenue from natural gas. 
Industries 
The economy of Bangladesh is mainly agro-based. Though the country is agro-based, 
yet as a developing country, the importance of industries is no less. Bangladesh still is 
not rich in industries. The number of industrial units is small. The major industries are : 
Jute industries : The geographical factors for the growth of jute industries are : 
climate, physiography, soil and the abundance of energy resources. The economic 
factors are the availability of raw materials, skilled and cheap labour force, market, 
capital, developed transport system and government enterpreneurship.

There was no jute industry in this country up to 1950. The first jute industry with 
1,000 looms was established in 1951 in Adamjeenagar of Narayanganj. This was 
largest jute mill of the world. But the government has closed it down as it was 
incurring loss. The total Jute Mills in Bangladesh is 99 at Private Sector but at present 
about 73 jute mills have been running. During 2008-09, the number of jute mills 
became 93 (Source : Bangladesh Statistical Pocketbook, 2009/February 2010, Page 
229). Narayanganj, Khulna and Chittagong are the three major jute industrial centres. 
Besides, there are jute mills in Demra, Ghorasal, Narsingdi, Bhairab Bazar, Gouripur, 
Madaripur, Chandpur, Sirajganj, and Habiganj (Fig. 88). 
Generally, hessains, guny bags, carpet, ropes etc. are manufactured in jute mills. 
Moreover, different types of hand bags, sandles, mats, dolls, show pieces etc. are also 
produced. Recently, the government has banned the use of polythene shopping bags 
under 100 micron, and as a result, the use of jute bags has increased. At one time, 55 
per cent of the total foreign earnings would have come through exports of jute and 
jute goods. The production of jute goods for several years and the foreign currency 
earned through exports are presented in Table 7. 
Table 7 : Production of jute goods and the earnings, Bangladesh, 1999-2009 
Sources : 1 Bangladesh Economic Survey, 2010, Table 33 
	 2 Bangladesh Economic Surv ey, 2010, Table 49 
It is mentioned earlier that a great portion of the foreign currency was derived through 
exports of jute and jute goods. The United States of America, United Kingdom, India, 
Egypt, Russia, Poland, Bulgaria, Belgium, Canada, Italy, Germany, Japan, France and 
other countries purchase jute and jute goods from Bangladesh. 
Due to the widespread use of synthetic fibres in the world, today the demand for jute 
and jute goods has declined greatly, and as a result, the production of jute in 
Bangladesh has also decreased to a great extent. 
Cotton textile industry : The second major industry is the cotton textile industry. 
Among the basic needs, cloth is placed next to food. Bangladesh is not self sufficient 
Bangladesh	 167 
in this industry. The main raw material for this industry is cotton which is produced in 
small quantity. The climate required for cotton textile industry is favourable. The 
yearly demand of cloth in Bangladesh is about 823 million metres. But the local 
industries produce only 450 million metres. The cotton produced is very little in 
comparison to the total requirement and is of low grade. Therefore, the textile 
industries are to depend on the imports of cotton. 
In 1947, there were only 8 cotton mills. These cotton mills had only 2,717 looms. 
During 1969-70, the number of cotton mills become 44. At present, a total of 63 
textile and yarn mills are in operation in Bangladesh (Fig. 89).

Soon after independence, the government of Bangladesh nationalised all the cotton 
and yarn mills and a little later, the responsibility for management and maintenance 
was handed over to Bangladesh Textile Mills Corporation (B.T.M.C). During 
1984-85, some of the mills were de-nationalised and at present, about 25 such mills 
are being maintained by private sector. 
About 10 lakh labourers are working in textile industries. But a major proportion of 
this is engaged in handloom industries working in rural areas. About 75 thousand 
workers are engaged in textile industries. 
Table 8 : Production of the cotton textile industry, Bangladesh, 1999-2009 
Source : Bangladesh Economic Survey, 2010, Table 33 
Textile industries have grown up in different places of Dhaka, Comilla, Noakhali and 
Chittagong of Bangladesh. The factors held responsible for growth of textile 
industries are mainly the supply of cheap labour, good transport and communication 
system, humid climate and the availability of local markets. About 24 textile mills 
have been established in Dhaka and in its surrounding areas. Cotton weaving 
industries have been developed in Tongi, Fatullah, Narayanganj, Kanchpur, Demra, 
Savar, and other regions. Fauzderhat, Sholoshahar, Panchlaish and Halishahar are the 
notable textile industrial centres in Chittagong region. This region is the second major 
textile industrial centre of the country. 
There are textile mills at Durgapur, Daulatpur, Halimanagar, Brahmanbaria, Debidwar 
and Feni in Comilla-Noakhali region. This region is the third textile industrial region 
of Bangladesh. 
At present, the quantity of cloth which is produced in Bangladesh is quite insufficient 
to meet the demand. Bangladesh imports huge quantity of cotton clothes and yarns 
from Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Korea, Pakistan and other countries every year. 
Paper industry : Paper industry is one of the largest industries of Bangladesh. The 
first paper mill was established in 1953. At present, there are 6 paper mills, 4 board 
mills and 1 newsprint mill in Bangladesh. The paper mills are Karnaphuli Paper Mill
Bangladesh	 169 
at Chandraghona in Rangamati district, the North Bengal Paper Mill at Pakshi in 
Pabna district, and Sylhet pulp and Paper Mill at Chhatak, Bashundhara, Magura and 
Shahjalal Paper Mills near Meghna ghat in Narayanganj district. Besides, of the 
Newsprint Mills, the Khulna Newsprint Mill, and of the board mills the Bangladesh 
Hard Board Mills, Adamjee Particle Board Mills, Kaptai and Tongi Board Mills are 
remarkable. The first and biggest mill is Karnaphuli Paper Mill. 
The bamboo, soft wood, reeds (nalkhagra), bagassee, jute sticks etc. are used as raw 
materials for the production of paper. Very recently the technology to produce high 
quality of paper has been invented using raw jute. 
Writing paper, printing paper, packing and other papers of high quality are produced. 
Production of paper and of Newsprint for a number of years is presented in Table 9. 
Table 9 : Production of paper and newsprint, Bangladesh, 1999-2009 
Source : Bangladesh Statistical Yearbook, 2009, Table 5.13 
There is scarcity of raw materials, chemicals, and power resources in paper industries. 
Proper supply of raw materials, abundant and regular supply of electricity and the 
creation of the world market is necessary for the development of this industry. 
Fertilizer industry : Bangladesh is an agricultural country. Fertilizer has got an 
important role to play to increase the fertility of the soil. Bangladesh needs more food 
to meet the demand of the increasing population. Fertilizer is necessary to increase the 
yield of the crop per acre. Along with the increase of the use of the organic fertilizer, 
the use of the chemical fertilizer has also increased. 
The factors for the growth of the fertilizer industries are the abundance of raw 
materials, availability of energy resources, market, cheap labour and good 
transportation system. 
The first fertilizer factory of Bangladesh was established in 1961 in Fenchuganj of 
Sylhet district. At present, fertilizer is being produced from eight fertilizer factories. 
The rest of the fertilizer factories are Ghorasal Fertilizer Factory, Ashuganj Fertilizer

Factory, Palash Urea Fertilizer Factory, Chittagong Tripple Super Phosphate Fertilizer 
Factory, Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Factory and Jamuna Fertilizer Factory and 
Fenchuganj Amonium Sulphate Fertilizer Factory (Fig. 90). Presently, Bangladesh 
needs 12 lakh tons of fertilizer. But the production of fertilizer is inadequate in 
comparison to the requirement. The information regarding fertilizer production is 
presented in Table 10. 
Fig. 90 : Fertilizer industry of Bangladesh
Bangladesh	 171 
Table 10 : Fertilizer production, Bangladesh, 1999-2009 
Source : Bangladesh Economic Survey, 2010, Table 33 
As Bangladesh is not self sufficient in fertilizer production, she has to import huge 
quantity of fertilizer every year. During 2001-02, Bangladesh imported fertilizer worth 
taka 615 crore. During 2009-10 (March, 10 till), Bangladesh imported fertilizer worth 
taka 4713 crore (Source : Bangladesh Economic Survey, 2010, Table 51). 
Fertilizer is one of the large scale industries. There are enough possibilities for the 
development of fertilizer industries due to availability of natural gas. It is expected 
that within few years, fertilizer may be expected after meeting the local needs. 
Sugar industry : Sugar industry is an important industry in Bangladesh. Sugar is an 
important element of food. In 1947, there were only 5 sugar mills in Bangladesh. At 
present, Bangladesh has got seventeen sugar mills. Among these sugar mills, the 
Rangpur Sugar Mill, Setabganj Sugar Mill, Thakurgoan Sugar Mill, Darshana Sugar 
Mill and Madhukhali Sugar Mill are remarkable industries. 
Sugarcane is the main raw material for sugar production. The sugarcane grows well in 
hot and humid climate. Therefore, it can be said that due to weather and soil, the sugar 
industries have developed in Bangladesh. For favourable weather, the sugar industries 
are located in the northern and weastern regions of the country ( Fig. 91).

The sugar mills of the country cannot produce sugar to their full capacity due to the 
storage of required sugarcane. During 1994-95, the sugar production was 2.70 lakh 
metric tons. The sugar production upto 1999-2009 is presented in Table 11.

At present, the sugar mills of Bangladesh are not capable of producing sugar to the 
requirement of the country. As a result, the producing in comparison to annual 
requirement falls short. Sugar worth taka 150 crore was imported during 1992-93. 
The main problem of sugar industries of Bangladesh is the uncertainty of supply of 
sugarcane. At one hand, due to the storage of sugarcane, the sugar mills could not use 
its full capacity of production and on the other hand, a tendency of produce molasses 
is observed. 
Garment industries : Garment industries have developed here as an important 
industry. Garment industries were developed to meet the local demand during early 
sixties and slowly turned into export oriented industries. During the end of the 
seventies and early eighties, export oriented garment industries started to flourish. 
About 92 garment industries started to export garments at the end of 1983. In 1984, 
the number of units were recorded at 455 in one year and in 1985 additional more 
units were established raising the total units to 715. Since then, this industry very 
rapidly topped the export list. 
Importance of the garment industries : The economic base of Bangladesh is 
dependent on agriculture. But the food that is produced cannot meet the demand of 
the people of the country. Every year, we have to import food at the cost of hard 
earned foreign currency. Since the emergence of Bangladesh, there has been a 
shortage of exports in comparison to imports. The rapid growth of ready-made 
garments has been a major contribution to the economic rejuvenation of Bangladesh. 
At present, there are about 1,000 export oriented garment units in the country. About 
75 per cent of the total units are located in Dhaka Metropolitan City. The rest of the 
units are in Chittagong Port City and few in Khulna. About 7 lakh labourers are 
engaged in this industry of which about 85 per cent are women. During 2001-02, 
Bangladesh earned foreign currency worth taka 17,947 crore, which accounts for 52 
per cent of the total foreign earnings. But during 2008-10, Bangladesh earned foreign 
currency worth taka 30,273 crore, which accounts for 38 per cent of the total foreign 
earnings. The contributions made by garment industries to the total export earnings is 
presented in Table 12.

Table 12 : Export earnings from garment industries, Bangladesh, 1998-2010 
Source : Bangladesh Economic Survey, 2010, Table 49 (the US dollar is converted into Bangladesh  
currency by using the conversion rate shown in the last column in this table). 
Huge quantity of ready-made garments are exported to the United States of America 
from Bangladesh. Next is Germany, then comes France, Italy. Britain, Netherlands, 
Canada, Belgium, Spain and other countries of the world. 
There is a favourable environment for the development of garment industries in 
Bangladesh. The availability of cheap labour is one of the main factors. Along with 
the development of this industry, skilled and unskilled labour, particularly, the low 
income group, has been able to increase their income and the total economy of the 
country has also improved. Now-a-days the garment industry is called a ÔBillion 
DollarÕ industry. 
Population 
In respect to population, the position of Bangladesh is nineth in the world. According 
to 1991 census, Bangladesh recorded 11.15 crore of people. The density of population 
is high in comparison to the land area. The annual population growth rate of our 
country is 2.17 per cent. 
Bangladesh is one of the densest countries of the world (Fig. 92 and 93). According to 
the Census Report, 2001, the population of Bangladesh is about 12.93 crore, the rate 
of increase is 1.48 per cent and the density of population is about 876 persons per 
square kilometre. At present, the population of Bangladesh is about 14.66 crore, the 
rate of increase is 1.39 per cent and the density of population is about 993 persons per 
square kilometre (Source : Bangladesh Statistical Pocketbook, 2009/February 2010, 
Page 7). If the present growth rate persists in the country, then the density of 
population would be increasing further. 
Population resource is one of the most important elements for the economic 
development of any country. If a country has sufficient resources but if the manpower

is not available in required number, then the natural resources cannot be utilised 
properly and as a result the economic development is hampered. On the other hand, if 
the population is comparatively more than the available resources, then it becomes a 
burden or a problem for the country. Trained manpower is a resource for any country.

I Dot = 12,000 People
176	 Secondary Geography 
The distribution of population of a country or a region depends on many factors. The 
outstanding factors for the distribution of the population are classified into two groups 
such as : (a) Physical, and (b) Non-physical. The physical and Non-physical factors 
are discussed below : 
(a) Physical factors 
1. Physiography : The physiography of Bangladesh being homogeneous, human 
settlements are found almost everywhere. The livelihood is tough in the hilly regions of 
Rangamati, Khagrachhari, Bandarban and in the Sunderban region and therefore the 
density of population in these regions are very low. As the railways and the road 
communication system is not well developed in those regions, making a living hard here. 
Therefore these regions are less densely populated. In the slopes of the hills of Sylhet, 
where there is tea cultivation, settlement has developed around the tea industries. 
Fig. 93 : Population density of Bangladesh 
BAY OF BENGAL
Bangladesh	 177 
The plains of the river valleys are fertile. Dense human settlements have developed 
due to ease of agriculture in these areas. The navigability of the rivers and the 
advantages of roads and railway communication have attracted people to these 
regions. 
1. Climate : Climate controls the distribution of settlement. People prefer to live in 
good climate rather than in extreme climate. The climate is almost the same in all over 
Bangladesh, but the variation of temperature between summer and winter is felt more 
in the northern region of the country. The plains attract people to live there because of 
the favourable climatic conditions for agriculture and crop production. 
(b) Non-physical factors 
1. Mineral resources : Labourers and workers have developed dense settlements in 
the regions where mineral resources are available. 
2. Industrial development : Mineral resources, agriculture resources, forest resources 
and animal resources have attracted people to develop settlements. In these regions, 
along with the major industries, some other related industries have developed. Due to 
the development of the industries and trade, the surrounding areas are turned into 
populous regions. As industrial towns have developed in Tejgaon, Tongi, Narsingdi, 
Khulna and Chittagong, the density of human settlements is high in such areas. 
3. Transportation system : If in a place, the road communication is well developed 
and if there is easy railway connection and if there are facilities of river 
communication, then it becomes easy for the place to maintain good linkages with 
other regions. In such case, the place becomes populous. 
4. Cultural effect : Now-a-days, education and culture have great influence on 
people. The development of science and technology, the bonds of philosophy and 
culture attract people closer and help to exchange their views. The regions having 
better education and cultural development will have more people. 
Necessity to Keep the Population Growth Stable 
Economic development is being hampered due to high population growth. To 
accelerate the development of Bangladesh, the population growth is to be arrested and 
the population should be kept stable due to the following reasons : 
1. To raise the standard of living by alleviating poverty; 
2. To minimize food shortage;
178	 Secondary Geography 
3. To reduce the pressure on agricultural land; 
4. To reduce the rate of unemployment; 
5. To maintain the pace of development; 
6. To generate capital; and 
7. To reduce the dependency rate. 
For this, it is required to develop the human resources and for which the following 
strategies are to be considered : 
1. To transform the population into human resources through a realistic multi-sectoral 
approach; 
2. To develop the standard of living of the rural people through expansion of 
education, agricultural development, establishment of industries and extension of 
medical facilities etc; 
3. To reduce the rate of growth of population and to have a planned family size; 
4. To increase the basic facilities. 
Transport System 
In the modern world, the transport system plays a vital role in the spread of the 
civilisation and in economic development. It is impossible to survive in this modern 
world, ignoring the transport system. We understand the transport system as the 
communication linkage between different places and the movement of goods and 
people. The transportation system may be of different types. The classification of the 
transport system of Bangladesh is discussed below : 
1. Land transportation : It means the road and railway communication system. The 
bus, lorry, truck, rickshaw etc. are the means of road transportation. Railway train or 
carriages are used for communication purposes. 
(a) Road : The construction and the maintenance of roads are very expensive due to 
the existence of innumerable rivers, khals, beels, abundant rainfall, physical structure 
of the land, and the financial constraints. In 1947, there were only 1,931.17 kilometres 
of metalled roads of which all season usable metalled road was only 386.23 
kilometres. During 1947-70, the total length of the road was 38,623.45 kilometres. 
According to 2007-08 the total length of the roadways is 2,86,507 kilometres 
(Fig. 94). The metalled road is 86,498 kilometres and unmetalled road is 2,00,009 
kilometres (Source : Bangladesh Statistical Pocketbook, 2009, Table 8.02, 8.03).

180	 Secondary Geography 
A look into the transport system of Bangladesh shows that a along with the 
mechanised transports, there are also the traditional transport like rickshaw, bullock 
carts, push carts etc. Due to the existence of the rivers, our roads are disrupted in 
many places. As a result, to keep the road communication in service, ferry services 
have been introduced. The eastern and the western parts of the country have been 
linked through Bangabandhu Bridge. As a result, the commodities and the passengers 
can eagily be transported by road within very short time. To develop the road 
communication system, an organisation named as the Bangladesh Road Transport 
Corporation (B.R.T.C.) was formed. The roads have been categorised as National 
Highways, Regional Roads, Zila Roads, Upazila Roads, Union Parisad Roads and the 
Village Roads. All Zila towns are well connected with Dhaka by road. But to go to 
many of these towns, ferry service is required. 
(b) Railways : At the time of independence in 1971, there was only 2,857 kilometres 
of railways. During 1995-96, Bangladesh had 2,706 kilometres of railway and during 
2001-02, the total length of the railway line recorded 2,768.37 kilometres. During 
2008-09, the total length of the railway line recorded only 2,835.04 kilometres 
(Source : Bangladesh Economic Survey, 2010, Table 43, Page 283). This is known as 
Bangladesh Railway. The railways are of three types viz., broad gauge, metre gauge 
and doual gauge (Fig. 95). 
During 1995-96, Bangladesh had 884 kilometres of broad gauge railway lines, but 
recently, it increased to 659.33 kilometres. This type of railway line is found in 
Khulna and Rajshahi Divisions. Some broad gauge lines are also found in Faridpur 
and Rajbari districts of Dhaka Division. During 1995-96, Bangladesh had 1,822 
kilometres of metre gauge railway line, but recently it increased to 1,800.88 
kilometres. Most of these line in Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet Divisions. On the 
other hand, form Zamtail to Joydevpur the distance of both metre gauge and broad 
gauge rail lines are 374.83 kilometres. The broad gauge, metre gauge and doual gauge 
lines in Bangladesh are divided into two parts by the Jamuna river. All of the metre 
gauge and doual gauge railway lines are on the east and broad gauge railway lines on 
the west. Direct railway communication between the eastern and the western parts of 
the country has been established through the Bangabandhu bridge. At present, a ferry 
service is running between Tistamukh and Bahadurabad ghats and between Sirajganj 
and Jagannathganj ghats.
Bangladesh	 181 
Fig. 95 : Railways of Bangladesh 
Railways exist in all the districts excepting the hilly districts of Rangamati, 
Khagrachhari, Bandarban and the districts of Barisal, Patuakhali and Barguna. There 
are 440 railway stations in total (Source : Bangladedh Statistical Pocketbook, 
2009/February 2010, Table 8.01). Out of these, Laksham, Akhaura, Mymensingh, 
Bhairab Bazar, Ishwardi, Parbatipur, Santahar, Bonarpara, Kaunia and Kamlapur of 
Dhaka junctions are particularly notable. Almost all the important towns are well 
connected with the capital of Dhaka through all these junctions. 
2. Waterways : The boats, launches and steamers are used in river communication, 
sea going vessels are necessary for sea communication. 
(a) River transportation : There are innumerable rivers in the country, but all the 
rivers are not navigable. Bangladesh has got 8,400 kilometres of inland navigable 
waterways. Out of this, about 5,400 kilometres remain usable all the year round and 
182	 Secondary Geography 
the rest of 3,000 kilometres is used only during rainy season. Navigable waterways 
are under the control of Inland Water Transport Authority. Small boats, launches, 
steamers, sea-trucks, ferries, tankers, coasters ply on the internal rivers of Bangladesh. 
Generally, the rivers in the south and in the east are more suitable for inland 
communication. Therefore, the important river ports are situated in these regions. Of 
these Dhaka, Narayanganj, Chandpur, Barisal, Jhalakhati, Khulna, Bhairab Bazar, 
Ashuganj, Mirkadim, Aricha and Sirajganj can be mentioned among river ports. 94 
per cent of the passengers travel by Tamburi boat, passenger boat (Gaina boat) and 
launches and the rest of 6 per cent by steamers (Fig. 96). 
Fig. 96 : Major waterways of Bangladesh 
(b) Ocean transportation : Ocean routes are very much important for trade. Heavy 
duty commercial commodities and the goods of large size are carried through ocean 
routes. Trade between the countries can be carried over by ocean routes. Bangladesh 
has got two sea ports for trade. The first one is Chittagong sea port and the second one 
is Mongla sea port.
Bangladesh	 183 
The Chittagong sea port is situated on the bank of Karnaphuli river. Chittagong port is 
called the gateway to Bangladesh. This port has got road and railway connection. 
There are many jetties in this port and about 24 sea vessels can anchor at a time. 
About 80 per cent of the trade of the country is carried through this port. 
The Mongla port is situated 50 kilometres south of Khulna at the confluence of the 
Passur and Mongla rivers. This port is connected by rivers with Barisal, Patuakhali 
and Faridpur. This port has got water and road connections. 
3. Airways : Airways is also known as skyways. During the modern age, the air 
communication is very important. For fast movement of passengers and cargo, the air 
is the best medium. The airways in Bangladesh occupies an important place in 
transportation system. 
Fig. 97 : Airways of Bangladesh
184	 Secondary Geography 
Two types of air services are available in Bangladesh, viz., internal air service and the 
international air service. Air services between the districts within the country is known 
as internal air service. Dhaka is connected with Chittagong, Jessore, Sylhet, Ishwardi, 
Saidpur, CoxÕs Bazar, Thakurgaon, Barisal and Rajshahi under the internal air service 
system and Jessore, CoxÕs Bazar, Sylhet, can also be travelled from Chittagong. On 
the other hand, when the Bangladesh Biman operates its air communication with other 
countries of the world, then it is called International Services of the Bangladesh 
Biman. Different countries of the world are linked with Dhaka and Chittagong in the 
international route (Fig. 97). 
Kurmitola of Dhaka is an international airport. Its name is Hazrat Shahjalal International 
Airport. Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport is the biggest airport of the country, next 
to it is the Chittagong Shah Amanat and Sylhet Osmani International Airport. The name 
of the Bangladesh Biman Organisation is Bangladesh Biman Airlines. 
Trade 
Selling and purchasing of goods to meet the demands of the people and the related 
activities are known as trade. Trade have influenced the economy of the country. In 
ancient times, trade was introduced through exchange of commercial goods due to 
non-existence of currency i.e. one would receive pulses or any other equal quantity of 
goods in exchange of same quantity of rice. Ordinarily it can be said that exchange of 
commodities is the trade. On the basis of kind and nature, trade can be divided into 
two, viz. Internal trade and International trade. 
Internal trade : When the commodities are sold or exchanged between the different 
regions within the country, it is called internal trade. As for example, if the tea of 
Sylhet of Bangladesh is sent to other regions within the country for selling, then it 
comes under the category of internal trade. 
International trade : When the commodities or goods are sold and purchased 
between different countries, then it is called international trade. International trade is 
of two types- import trade and export trade. 
Import trade : To meet the requirements of the country when the goods are brought 
from another country, then it is called import trade. As for example, Bangladesh is to 
import baby food, machineries, food items, industrial raw materials and goods, 
medicine, chemicals, consumable items etc. to meet the needs of the country. Some of 
the major imported items are discussed below : 
Consumable essential goods : To meet the food shortage, rice, wheat, edible oil, 
sugarcane, baby food, oil seeds are imported.
Bangladesh	 185 
Industrial goods : Main imported items for the industrial development are machineries, 
instruments, coal, cement, diesel, petrol, cotton yarn, electrical goods, iron and steel. 
Machineries and raw materials : Though Bangladesh is an agricultural country, it is 
not developed in agriculture. Agricultural implements, insecticides, high quality seeds 
and fertilizers are necessary to increase agricultural productivity. On the other hand, to 
increase industrial production, high quality machineries, instruments, raw materials 
etc. are necessary. Therefore these materials are imported. 
Besides these, Bangladesh imports medicine, glass, motor cars, bicycles, radioes, 
watches, televisions, refrigerators, buses, trucks, rubber goods etc, from foreign 
countries. The countries from where Bangladesh imports the goods are the U.S.A., 
Canada, the U.K., India, Japan, France, Singapore, China and Taiwan. 
Export trade : When the commodities of our own country are sent to other countries, 
then it is known as export trade. As for example, the ready-made garments, jute, jute 
goods, leather and tea of Bangladesh are sent to other countries of the world. Some of 
the major exportable items are discussed below : 
Ready-made garments : At present, Bangladesh earns its maximum foreign currency 
by exporting ready-made garments. During 1997-98, ready-made garments worth taka 
12,924 crore, and during 2003-04 worth taka 20,853 crore were exported. Now, in 
2009-10 it the export value has increased to 30,273 crores. 
Raw jute : Once, about 75 per cent of the total world production of jute was produced 
in Bangladesh. The U.K., India, China, Japan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, Iran, and 
Russia are the main buyers of raw jute from Bangladesh. 
Jute goods : Bangladesh earns foreign currency by exporting hessains, bags, gunny 
bags, carpets etc. to foreign countries. About 35 per cent of the total export earnings 
come from jute goods. The jute goods are exported to Japan, the U.S.A., the U.K., 
France, Germany, Italy, India and China. 
Tea : Tea stands sixth in respect of earning foreign currency. There are 158 tea 
gardens in Bangladesh. She exports tea to the U.K., the U.S.A., Russia, Netherlands, 
Japan and Pakistan. 
Leather and leather goods : Bangladesh every year earns foreign currency by 
exporting the cow, buffalow and goat leather. The leather and leather goods have 
occupied the fourth place in the field of exports. Bangladesh mainly exports leather 
and leather goods to the U.S.A., the U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Belgium and Japan. 
Fish and frozen food : Fish and dried fish, frog leg, shrimp and other frozen foods 
are exported from Bangladesh. 
186	 Secondary Geography 
Table 13 : Foreign currency earned through exports, Bangladesh, 2000-2010 
Source : Bangladesh Economic Survey, 2010, Table 49 
Paper and Newsprint : Bangladesh after meeting the local requirements, exports 
paper and newsprint every year. At present, paper is imported for our own 
consumption. 
Others : Other exportable items are naptha, furnace oil, handicrafts and agricultural 
products. 
A comparative statement of the expenses for imports and the earnings from exports is 
presented in the Table 14. 
We have got enough quantity of natural 
resources. But due to the shortage of capital 
and technical know how, the natural 
resources are not properly utilised. For this, 
there is no balance between imports and 
exports. During 2003-04, Bangladesh 
imported goods worth taka 64,262 crore and 
exported goods worth taka 44,812 crore. In 
2009-10, Bangladesh imported goods worth 
taka 1,20,217 crore and exported goods 
worth taka 80,706 crore (Source : 
Bangladesh Economic Survey, 2010). Whole 
hearted co-operation is necessary to develop 
the economy of the country by increasing 
the exports and thereby to overcome the 
shortage in international trade. For this, 
increase in production, improvement of the 
quality of goods, reduction of the cost of 
production, reduction in internal 
consumption, reduction of export duties, 
development of transport system, wide 
advertisement of the exportable items are 
indespensible.

Part Four 
Practical Geography 
Chapter One 
Drawing of Scales 
Definition of scale : Scale is defined as a ratio of the distance between two points on 
the map to the corresponding actual distance on the ground. If, for instance, the 
distance between two points on a map is 1 cm. and the corresponding actual distance 
between those two points on the ground is 10 kms., then, the map has been drawn to a 
scale of 1 cm. to 10 kms. Hence, the ratio existing between 1 cm. and 10 kms. is the 
scale. It is necessary to keep in mind that the expression of 1 cm. = 10 kms. is not 
mathematically correct. It is not possible to show the actual area or the actual distance 
on any sheet of paper of a definite size. Hence, the actual area or the distance is 
measured and according to the requirement, it is reduced and then drawn on the paper. 
So, the ratio of the distance on the paper to the actual distance is the scale. 
Method of showing scale on the map : There are three ways the scale is depicted on 
the map. 
(a) By statement : We express the scale of a map by statement or by language. As for 
instance, 1 inch to 4 miles, 16 inches to a mile, 1 cm. to 1 hectometre. Here, in every 
case, the first figure (either expressed in inches or in cms.) indicates the distance on 
the map and the second figure (whether expressed in miles, yards, kilometres or 
hectometres) indicates the corresponding actual distance on the ground. 
(b) By graphical method : By dividing a line of inches or of cms. into equal parts 
and further into smaller divisions and marking the values to each part, the scale of the 
map is expressed. As, for instance, if the scale of 1 cm. to 10 kms. is to be expressed 
graphically, then a line of 5 cms. long is to be divided into 5 equal parts and the value 
of each part would be 10 kms. Leaving aside 1 part to the left, the divisions are 
marked as 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 sequentially and the unit of kms. is put. The left part 
further would be divided into smaller 10 divisions (to show the smaller units of 10 
kms.) land each smaller part is marked (Fig. 98 a). 
Kilometres Kilometres
Practical Geography	 197 
Mile s 4 3 2 1 0 4 8 Miles 
The same rule is also to be followed in case of scale of inches (Fig. 98 b). Here, a line 
of 3 inches long is to be divided, first, into three equal parts, then leaving one division 
to the left, each division is marked and the left part divided further into smaller 
divisions. At the time of expressing the statement of 1 inch to 4 miles graphically, a 
line of 3 inches long is to be divided into 3 equal parts, leaving one part to the left, the 
divisions are marked as 0, 4, 8 and the unit of mile is mentioned. The left part is also 
divided into 4 equal parts (1 inch = 4 miles). Sequentially, the values of 1, 2, 3, 4 
miles starting from 0 to the left are put. 
Fig. 98 (b) : Liner scale 
(c) By Representative Fraction (R.F.) : An independent unit of scale is used to 
measure the distances for different countries. If the scale in a map is expressed in the 
unit of one country, then it may not be acceptable to another country due to language 
problem. To overcome this disadvantage, the R.F. method has been introduced. In 
English, it is known as Representative Fraction and the abbreviation is R.F. This 
expresses the proportion of the scale by a fraction in which the numerator is 1 which 
denotes the length on the map and the denominator in the same unit denotes the 
corresponding length on the ground. As for example, if we have to express the scale of 
1 cm. to 1 metre in R.F., then the metre is to be converted into cms. and the symbol (t) 
in between such two figures is to be put. 1 mt. = 100 cms. Therefore, the numerator is 
1 and the denominator is 100. So, the scale would be 1 t 100 or 1/100. It means that 
when the distance on the map is 1 cm., the corresponding distance on the ground is 
100 cms. 
Again, in the British system, the R.F. 1 t 36, means the distance of 1 inch on the map 
and the corresponding distance of 36 inches on the ground, i. e., 1 yard (36 inches = 
1 yard). Hence, the statement scale is 1 inch to 1 yard. The scale of 1 inch to 1 mile is 
expressed as R.F. 1 t 63360, as 1 mile = 63360 inches 
Conversion of scale 
From statement to R.F. 
1. 	1 inch to 2 yards (1 yard = 36 inches) 
	2 yards = 36 ´ 2 = 72 inches. 
	So, R.F . is 1 t 72 
2. 	3 inches to 9 miles 
	1 inch to = 3 miles 
	3 miles = 63360 ´ 3 = 190080 inches. 
	So, R.F . is 1 t 190080

3. 	1 inch to 1 furlong 
	 I furlong = 7920 inches. 
	(8 furlongs = 1 mile; 
	or , 8 furlongs = 63360 inches, 
	I furlong = = 7920 inches) 
	So, R.F . 1t 7920 
4. 	1 centimetr e to 2 kilometres 
	W e know, 100000 cms. = 1 km. 
	2 kms. = 100000 ´ 2 = 200000 cms. 
	So, R.F . 1 t 200000 
5. 	1 centimetr e to 5 metres 
	W e know that 100 cms. = 1 mt. 
	So, 5 mts. = 100 ´ 5 = 500 cms. 
	1 cm. = 500 cms. 
	So, R.F . 1 t 500 
From R.F. to statement 
1. 		 The R.F. 1 t 633600. Here, it is easier to convert the given R.F. into	English 
system. 
	W e know that 1 mile = 63360 inches. 
	So, 633600 ¸ 63360 = 10 miles. 
	Hence, the statement is 1 inch to 10 miles. 
2. 	R.F. 1 t 10000. Here it is easier to convert the given R.F. into metric system. 
	W e know that 10000 cms. = 1 hectometre. 
	So, 10000 ¸ 10000 = 1 hectometre. 
	Hence, the statement is 1 cm. to 1 hectometre. 
3. 	R.F. 1 t 100. Here, it is easier to convert the given R.F. into metric system. 
	W e know that 100 cms. = 1 metre. 
	So, 100 ¸ 100 = 1 metre. 
	Hence, the statement is 1 cm. to 1 metre. 
4. 	R.F. 1 t 79200 
	W e know, 7920 cms. = 1 furlong. 
	So, 79200 ¸ 7920 = 10 furlongs. 
	Hence, the statement is 1 inch to 10 furlongs. 
5. 	R.F. 1 t 120 
	W e know, 12 inches = 1 feet. 
	So, 120 ¸ 12 =10 feet. 
	Hence, the statement is 1 inch to 10 feet.

Classification of scales : The scale is classified into different groups. Generally, the 
simple scale, diagonal scale, comparative scale, time scale, scale of slope, 
proportional scale and vernier scale are in use. 
Linear scale : In English, the terms-the Simple scale, Linear scale, Plain scale and 
Graphic scale are all the same but generally the term Simple scale is used. 
Drawing of simple scale : A line of required length is divided into a number of big 
equal divisions and the values of each division is put leaving one division to the left 
which is further sub-divided into smaller divisions and each smaller division is 
marked. The big divisions are known as primary and the smaller divisions to the left 
as secondary part. It is remarkable to note that the length of the scale and the number 
of divisions would depend on the nature of the scales to be drawn. 
Length of the scale : Scale of any length can be drawn. But it is necessary to draw 
the scale taking into consideration the beauty and the size of the paper. Generally, for 
classroom practical khata, the length of the scale should be within 4.5 inches to 6 
inches or 12 kms. is 15 cms. So, it becomes befitting and gives a good look, otherwise 
it looks odd. 
In small size maps of large scale, the scale of 5 to 6 cms. or 2 to 3 inches length is 
drawn. A thin scale looks nice. Hence, thin or narrow scales are drawn. Almost in all 
cases, the simple scale of 0.2 inch width or even less than this is chosen and divided 
horizontally into two parts. 
Division of line : Different methods of dividing a line is shown below : 
Say, the preliminary part of a line is to be divided into 4 equal parts and the secondary 
part into 5. 
(a) It is possible to divide a line with the help of a divider by trial and error method. 
(b) If the scale is 4.5 inches long, then the length of one division is 4.5 ¸ 4 = 1.125 
inches. Now, it would be possible to divide the line with the help of a divider taking 
the length of 1.13 inches instead of 1.125 inches. 
(c) Firstly, a line AB of any length is taken. Primarily, this line is to be divided into 4 
equal parts. To the left of this line, an angle <BAC of 24° or 30° at A is drawn. With 
the help of a ruler, the line AC is divided into 4 parts each of 1 inch length. Mark these 
points as d, e, f, c. Then CB is joined. With the help of set squares the parallel lines to 
BC are drawn from d, e, f. The line AB primarily will be divided into 4 equal parts. 
Keeping one part to the left, the divisions are marked as 0, 1, 2 and 3.
200	 Secondary Geography 
For secondary part, two perpendiculars one above at ÔAÕ and the other below at Ô0Õ are 
drawn. These two lines are divided into 5 equal parts of any length. These are marked 
on both sides of AB as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The points 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 of the above 
perpendicular line are joined respectively with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 of the line below. The 
left part would be divided into 5 equal parts. Starting from Ô0Õ at increasing rate 
towards left the points are marked as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (Fig. 99). 
Fig. 99 : Dividing a line 
Method of drawing simple scales : To make the drawing procedures easier few 
examples are cited below : 
Example 1 : 5 inches to 5 miles; draw a simple scale. 
Drawing procedure : A line of 5 inches long is divided into 5 equal parts. Each 
primary division will represent 1 mile. Keeping I primary part to the left, the points 
are marked towards right as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. For secondary, the left part is divided into 8 
equal parts (as 8 furlongs = 1 mile). On the right, the unit of mile and on the left the 
unit of furlongs is mentioned. 1 inch to 5 miles. So, 63360 x 5 = 316800 inches. 
Hence, R.F. 1 t 316800 (Fig. 100 a). 
R. F. 1t 316800 
Fig. 100 (a) : Liner scale 
Example 2 :	1 cm. to 1 km.; a simple scale is to be drawn. 
	 	 	1 cm. to 1 km. 	 	as, 1 km. = 100000 cms. 
	 	 	12 cms. is 12 kms. 		Hence, R.F . 1 t 100000 
Drawing procedures : A line of 12 cms. long is divided primarily into 12 equal parts. 
Keeping 1 primary part to the left, the divisions, are marked as 0, 1, 2, .................11 
and the unit of km. is mentioned. 1 km = 10 hectometres. So, the secondary part is 
further divided into 10 equal parts. The divisions are marked towards left starting 
from 0 as 1, 2, 3, ............. 10, and the unit of hectometre is mentioned. Just below the 
scale at central position, the R.F. 1 t 100000 is written (Fig. l00 b).

Practical Geography	 201 
Example 3 : 1 inch to 4 miles; a simple scale is to be drawn. 
When the distance between two points on the ground is 4 miles, then the 
map distance is 1inch. 
When the distence between two points on the ground is 1 mile then the 
map distance is inch. 
When the distance between two points on the ground is 20 miles then, 
the map distance is = 5 inches. 
This calculation can be done in another way. 
Say, I will draw a scale of 5 inches in length. 
When the map distance is 1 inch, the ground distance is 4 miles. 
When the map distance is 5 inches the ground distance is 4 x 5" = 20 miles. 
Drawing procedure : The values of the divisions on the scale have to be shown as 5, 
10, 15 or as 10, 20, 30. It cannot be shown as 4, 8, 12 or 3, 6, 9. The 5 inches line as 
obtained through calculation is divided into 4 equal parts. Leaving I part to the left, 
the values of the divisions are put as 0, 5, 10, 15 sequentially to the right. As each of 
the primary divisions represents 5 miles, so the left part is divided into 5 equal parts. 
The mile unit is mentioned both to the left and right of the scale. 1 inch represents 4 
miles. 4 miles = 63360 x 4 = 253440 inches. So, R. F. is 1t 253440. This R. F. is to be 
mentioned just below the scale. With the help of a divider, the distances of 7, 13 and 
19 miles can easily be measured using this scale (Fig. l00 c)

Example 4 : With 1 centimetre to 1 hectometre, a simple scale is to be drawn. 
1 centimetre reprents 1 hectometre; as 1 hectometre = 10 centimetre 
Hence, R.F. 1 t 10000 
Drawing procedure : Primarily, a line of 10 cms. long is divided into 10 equal parts. 
Keeping 1 part to the left, other divisions are marked as 0, 1, 2, 3, ...........9. As, 1 hec. 
is equal to 10 decametres, so the left part is divided into 10 equal parts (secondary).

Example 5 : With 3 inches to 15 yards, draw a simple scale. 
3 inches represents 15 yards. We know 36 inches = 1 yard. 
1 inch represents = 5 yards. 5 yards = 36 x 5 = 180 inches. 
Hence, R.F. 1 t 180 
When 5 yards is the ground distance, the map distance is 1 inch. 
1 yard is the ground distance, the map distance is inch. 
25 yards is the ground distance, the map distance is inches = 5 
inches. 
Drawing procedure : A line of 5 inches long is drawn. Primarily, it is divided into 5 
equal parts. Each division represents 5 yards. Then the left part is divided into 5 equal 
parts. Each division on this secondary part would represents 1 yard each (Fig. l00 e).

Advantages of Using the Scale 
1. 	 The distance existing between two points on the map is known. 
2.	 The linear scale for general use is very simple to follow. 
3. 	 A map with linear scale, if enlarged or reduced using photostat machine, the scale 
is also proportionately enlarged or reduced. 
4. If R.F. is supplied in any map, then we can use it according to our unit. 
Disadvantages of Using the Scale 
1. 	The measurement unit of length is different in different countries. Scale given in 		 
a map of one country cannot be used by another country. 
2. 	 If the scale drawn is faulty, and if used, would give wrong results. 
3. 	 Language problem : Different countries have different languages. Map expressed 
in the language of one country cannot be understood by the people of another 			 
country. As a result, the units used in the scale of a map cannot be followed by 			 
the people of other country. 
Drawing of Scales 
What we learnt from this chapter : 
Scale : Scale is defined as a ratio of the distance between two points on the map to the 
corresponding distance on the ground. 
Method of showing scale on the map : The scale is depicted on the map by three 
methods, (a) By statement, (b) By graphical method, and (c) By Representative 
Fraction (R.F.). 
Length of the scale : A scale of 4.5" to 6" length should be drawn in practical khata.

size is a plan. Scale is also used to draw sketches as that of maps. The length, breadth 
and size of any area if reduced and presented on a paper according to specific scale 
one gets a clear idea of the size and the location of that area. 
In reality, a big school and its yard occupies a great area on the ground. The whole 
complex can be shown in a plan on some reduced scale. 
Drawing procedure of a plan : During plan preparation, a metallic tape of feet, 
inches or metre is used. First, a rough sketch map is prepared of the area which is to 
be sketched. The linear and the angular measurements are noted in a field book or in a 
sheet of paper. Afterwards, the plan of the area is drawn using a specific scale. 
Generally, the surveyors or Amins use a scale of 1 inch to 8 feet or 1 cm. to 10 metres, 
at the time of drawing the plans of houses, settlemens, schools etc. A procedure for 
plan drawing of a school is shown below (Fig. 101). 
Plan of a school : The play ground, garden and the boundary wall is measured. The 
length of the boundary wall measured is 135 metres and the breadth is 70 metres. A 
scale of 1 cm. to 10 metres is chosen to draw the plan. 
10 metres = 1000 centimetres 
So, R.F. is 1 t 1000 
The length of the boundary wall is 135 metres breadth is 70 metres. 
So, 
The length of the wall, 	 	 	 	135 ¸ 10	= 13.5 	cms. 
The breadth of the wall, 	 	 	 	 70 ¸ 10	= 7.0	cms. 
Length of the school, 	 	 	 	 70 ¸ 10 	= 7.0	 cms. 
Breadth of the school, 	 	 	 	 55 ¸ 10 	= 5.5	cms. 
Length of the play ground,		 	 	 55 ¸ 10	= 5.5	cms. 
Breadth of the play ground, 	 	 	 40 ¸ 10	= 4.0	cms. 
Length of the garden, 	 	 	 	 55 ¸ 10 	= 5.5	 cms. 
Breadth of the garden, 	 	 	 	 42 ¸ 10 	= 4.2	 cms. 
Location of the gate from the western side. 	 40 ¸ 10 	= 4.0	 cms.

Fig. 101 : Plan of a school 
Drawing procedure : Take a line of 13.5 cms. long and draw two perpendiculars of 7 
cms. long at each end of this line to get the school premises. Leaving a space of 0.5 
cm. to the north, 0.8 cm. to the east. 1.2 cms. to the west and 1 cm. to the south, the 
plan of the school has been prepared comprising of the school building, play ground 
and the garden (Fig. 101).

International Conventional Signs 
Definition : The internationally accepted signs used in maps and plan to show the 
boundary of any area, roads, railways, rivers, canals, wells, ponds, lakes, marshy 
lands, grasslands, deserts with oasis, mountains, mountain peaks, small and big towns, 
mosque, idgah, temple, church, pagoda, graveyard, port, lighthouse, oil-well, 
battlefield etc. are known as International Conventional Signs. The cartographers of 
the world use these conventional signs in maps and plans. Few of the generally used 
conventional signs are shown below to give an idea of these signs used by different 
countries of the world (Fig. 103 and 104).

Map Reading 
Definition of map : Map is a representation of any part of the earth or the earth as a 
whole on some reduced scale with latitudes and longitudes in a plain sheet of paper. 
To draw a map of any part of the world (continent, country, district, thana, village 
etc.), an accurate survey work is to be conducted or if the area is small, then the 
photograph is to be taken. 
Classification of map : There may be various types of maps. Generally, on the basis 
of the scale used in maps and the subject matter, the maps are classified into two 
groups. According to the scale used, again the maps are of two types : 
(a) Large scale maps, and 
(b) Small scale maps. 
Navigation charts, aero-nautical charts, mouza maps or cadastral maps etc. are all 
large scale maps. As a small area is enlarged, so many data or information can be 
accommodated in the map. Atlasses, wall maps etc. are small scale maps. The whole 
world or the continent or any big region like that of a country when shown on a sheet 
of paper, small space remains in the map. So, not much information can be shown on 
this type of map. 
According to subject matter, the maps are of two types : 
(a) Qualitative map, and 
(b) Quantitative map. 
(a) Qualitative map : Geological map, topo-map, relief map, soil map, wall map, 
atlasses, topographical map and mouza map are of this type. 
(b) Quantitative map : Air temperature, amount of rainfall, distribution of 
population, density of population, mineral extraction, forest production, agricultural 
production etc. shown on a map is known as quantitative map. 
Map reading procedure : We not only see the map, but also read it. Map reading is 
necessary if we have to discuss the items shown in the map. The procedure to read the 
map according to the types and nature is also different. In the physical maps, the 
location of the mountains, plateaus, hills, valleys, plain lands, rivers, lakes, deltas, 
210	 Secondary Geography 
oceans and seas etc. are shown using the conventional signs. The physical features of 
Asia have been shown in Fig. 57. Extension of the mountains from Pamir Knot, the 
location of plateaus between the mountains, existence of plain lands etc. in Asia can 
be studied using this map. With the help of contour lines, the elevation and the relief 
can be shown. It is not possible to study such maps without having the knowledge of 
the definition, the characteristics of contours, location of vertical and normal slope. 
The climatic divisions of Europe has been shown in Fig. 54. What type of climate is 
prevailing in which part of this map can be explained if properly studied. Again, the 
weather map is of different type. Ideas can be had regarding the high and low pressure 
areas, wind direction, amount of rainfall, cloud cover, ocean conditions etc. Boundary 
of each plot of a mouza is shown in the mouza map, hence, the boundary of the plot 
can be determined according to the Dag number of the plot and these maps are used to 
realise the government revenue. A topographical map is prepared of the villages 
situated side by side or enlarging such a small village. Physical features such as 
Fig. 105 : A map of a village 
mountains, plateaus, forests, lakes etc. can be shown using the conventional signs. 
Besides, the cultural aspects such as roads, railways, airports, settlements, towns, 
cities, canals, bridges, ferry ghats etc. too can be shown. One should have the 
knowledge about parallels, meridians, scales, different conventional signs etc. before 
reading such maps.
Practical Geography	 211 
Fig.105 represents a map of a village. Rivers, railways, roads have passed through this 
village. There are North Para, South Para, West Para, mosques, temples, post office, 
school, market, crop fields etc. shown in different places in this map. 
To study this map, one should have the knowledge beforehand about the directions. 
Upper part of the map indicates the North, the opposite is the South, the right hand 
side of the reader, the East and the left side, the West. Then the location of the market, 
post office etc. according to scale is to be studied. It is better to give different titles of 
the subject matter studied. Reading procedure for Fig. 105, and the steps to be 
followed are explained below. 
Terminal information : This map has been prepared at the scale of 1 inch to 4 miles. 
There does not exist any parallel and meridian in a topo map. So, no parallel and 
meridian has also been shown in this plan (Fig. 105). 
Physical features : There is no hill or high land in this village. There is a marshy land 
to the east-central place and one swamp to the south-east. The normal slope is towards 
south-east. 
Drainage system : A major meandering river is found to pass through the central part 
of the village from north-west to south-east. A small river flowing from the north joins 
the main stream at the north-west corner of the village. A bit bigger river coming from 
south-west joins the main stream. The main river comes under the influence of tide 
and as a result, the other rivers are also affected. 
Communication system : An unmetalled road coming from the west has crossed the 
river. Some portion of the east-west road near the river is metalled and the rest is 
unmetalled. Two unmetalled roads coming from north and north-east join this 
metalled road. One unmetalled road coming from the railway station in the south 
terminates at the river side. The railway line in the south of this village runs from 
north-east to south-west. The steamer plies always in the main river. The water 
communication is maintained by boat in other rivers. The railway line and the road 
crossed the river through a bridge. The communication system of the village is 
developed. 
Settlements : There are six scattered settlements in this village, viz., North Para, 
South Para, East Para, Central Para, West Para and FishermenÕs Para, there is a 
mosque by the side of the school at West Para and a temple in the FishermenÕs Para. 
The concentration of the houses is found to exist in the West Para only. There is a 
school located almost at the central place of the village. The market located by the 
212	 Secondary Geography 
side of the river is the only marketing centre for the inhabitants. There is a post office 
in this village. The grassland situated in the northern part of the village is used as the 
grazing land for the cattles of the farmers. 
Agricultural land : 80 per cent of the total land of the village is under crop. The land 
has been fragmented gradually due to the application of the law of inheritance. It is 
possible to irrigate the land from rivers and swamps during the dry season. Agriculture 
is the main occupation of the inhabitants of the village. 
Map Reading 
What we learnt from this chapter : 
Definition of map : Map is the representation of any part of the earth or the earth as a 
whole on some reduced scale on a plain sheet of paper. 
Classification of maps : According to the scale used and the subject matter, the maps 
are divided into two. According to the scale, the map can be sub-divided into two, (a) 
large scale map, and (b) small scale map. According to the subject matter presented, 
the map is classified into two as (a) qualitative, and (b) quantitative. 
Map reading : The techniques of map reading of different maps are different. 
Different conventional signs and lines are used in the physical maps. For climatic map 
reading, one should have clear ideas about cloud cover, amount of rainfall, conditions 
of the ocean etc. Different types of maps should be studied using different techniques.

Drawing of Bangladesh Map 
It is easy to draw a map by square method and the learners will be able to acquire this 
method very quickly and easily. The north-south extension of the map of Bangladesh 
is about 1.4 times more than the east-west extension. The latitudes and longitudes are 
taken as the basis during drawing of squares, then by practice, the learners can have 
the knowledge about the location of important cities, towns, ports, hillocks, rivers, 
haors etc. 
Fig. 106 : To make the squares for Bangladesh map boundary
214	 Secondary Geography 
Drawing techniques : Our country is generally located between 20° to 27° north 
latitudes and 88° to 93° east longitudes. Hence, for north to south extension 7 squares 
to cover 20° to 27° north parallels and for east to west extension, 5 squares to cover 
88° to 93° of east longitude are to be drawn to accommodate 35 full squares. Small 
squares, if drawn at the margins, may cause errors in case of drawing the boundary 
line of the country. A vercal line of 5.6 inches long and a horizontal line of 4.0 inches 
long have to be divided into 7 and 5 equal parts respectively (Fig. 106). After this, a 
standard map of Bangladesh, is followed to draw the boundary line of the map in this 
net of squares (Fig. 106) 
Fig. 107 : Drawing method of Bangladesh boundary map 
In reality, though the latitudes and longitudes are not equally spaced, but for the learners 
these have been equally spaced for the convenience of the learners (Fig. 107). 7 squares 
from north to south and 5 squares from east to west i. e. a total of 35 squares have been 
drawn taking each side of vertical and horizontal squares as 1 inch (Fig. 107).

To the drawn net of squares, put the values on the right line from bottom to the top 
(south to north) as 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 degrees and 88, 89, 90, 91, 92 and 93 
degrees to the bottom line from left to right (west to east). 
Then a standard map of Bangladesh is followed to draw the boundary line of 
Bangladesh in this net of squares. The learners would be able to draw the map 
themselves in the net of squares without using the original map if they practice on it 
for 4 to 5 times. The map would be large or small depending on whether the length of 
the side of squares would be big or small (Fig. 107).

Representation of Data 
Definition : The information as available in the form of figures about temperature, 
rainfall, agriculture or industrial production is known as data. The data thus available 
when presented using some special techniques in graphical form is known as 
representation of data. Rainfall, frost, temperature, air pressure etc. related to climatic 
data and the area of any country or region, population, acreage of cropped area, 
production of crop, exports and imports or the money spent for imported goods, 
foreign currency earned through exports etc. are economic data. All the data in the 
form of statistics are known as geographical data. 
Uses : Different graphical representation of data are used in the office rooms to 
exhibit openly the data for general information of the public and for advertisement in 
the news paper. The learners should know the techniques for graphical representation 
of data. In most cases, though the data are represented on a plain sheet of paper, but 
sometimes, the data are also graphically represented on the maps. Generally, the data 
are presented using isotherms, isobars, bar columns, pie-graphs, circular diagrams, dot 
method, shading etc. Some of the easier methods to represent data are discussed 
below : 
1. Bar graph : It is better to use graph paper by the learners for practising for the first 
time and repeating the process for several times, the learners would be able to draw 
graphs on a plain sheet of paper. If the columns are erected, vertically, then it is 
known as bar column and if horizontally placed, called bar graph. 
Sample 1 : In the following table, the rice productions of Bangladesh for different 
years are shown. These data are to be represented by bar columns (Fig. 109).

Representation of Data 
What we learnt from this chapter : 
Data : The information available in the form of figures regarding the temperature, 
rainfall, agricultural and industrial production etc. are known as data. 
Graphical representation of data : If the available data is presented by graphs then 
it is known as graphical representation of data. Bar column and line graphs are the 
easiest methods for graphical representation of data. 
Bar column : If the available data is presented by columns, then it is known as bar 
column. Crop and industrial production etc. are shown by this method. It is easy to 
draw and people can understand it. 
Line graph : The data presented by a line is known as line graph. The inter-related 
data is generally presented by line graph. The body temperature, air temperature,
